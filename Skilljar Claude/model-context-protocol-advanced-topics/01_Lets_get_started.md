# Let's get started!

## Transcript

Hello and welcome. My name is Stephen Grider

and I'm a member of Technical Staff at Anthropic. In

this course, you're going to learn a wide variety of advanced

topics around model context protocol. Before

we dive in, I want to give you a quick overview of some

of the different topics we will be discussing.

We will begin with sampling, which allows an MCP

server to request a client to call a language model

like Claude to generate some amount of text. We'll

then take a look at providing better feedback to clients accessing

your MCP server by using logging and progress

notifications. After that, we'll spend some

time discussing routes, which allow you to point an

MCP server to specific files or folders that

it should access. From there, we'll take a deeper

look at the MCP spec itself to

really help you understand the technical side of server

client communication by looking at the specific

message format that MCP uses. We

will then immediately apply that knowledge to see how the standard

IO transport works and then close out with a very

deep dive on remotely hosted servers using

the streamable HTTP transport.

There is a lot of content here, so to make sure we can

get through all these different topics, there are a couple of things

that you need to know ahead of time. First, we will

be looking at a lot of Python code. Now you don't need

to be a Python expert, but you should at least be able to

read Python. Second, you should already have a

basic understanding of MCP, including clients,

servers, and tools. So with that, let's

dive into our first technical topic.
