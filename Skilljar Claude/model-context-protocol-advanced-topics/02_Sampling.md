# Sampling

## Transcript

Sampling allows a server to access a language model like

Claude through a connected MCP client. To

help you understand what that means and what sampling is all about,

I want to show you a quick demo application. So

here we go. This is a chat application that

is powered by Claude, so I can ask it what's one plus

one, and I'll get a response back. This chat

application is also connected to a single MCP

server that implements one tool called the Research

Tool. I can use this tool to ask Claude to maybe

write a report on archaeology. And when I do so,

Claude is going to decide to use that research tool, is saying

you're going to go and do some research, synthesize all the results,

and then present a report back to me. Now

that you have seen this research tool run, I like to show

you what is going on behind the scenes in this application and how

the research tool actually works. All right,

so here's a high-level overview of what's going on. First,

at the very top left, I've got a next JS application

that's what's actually rendering some content inside the browser, and

that's got an integrated MCP client inside of

it. A user at some point in time is going to ask

us to research a topic like archaeology. We're

going to send that query off to Claude, and Claude is going to decide

to run the research tool that it has been provided

ahead of time. Our MCP client

on the next JS application is going to translate that into a

tool called Request and send it over to the MCP

server. Then on the MCP server, the

research tool is going to run. It's going to make a number of

requests off to Wikipedia and try to find some articles

around archaeology and then some related content

and so on. Once the research tool has fetched some

number of pages from Wikipedia, we need to take all that

content and synthesize it into a final report that

can be displayed to the user. And there's more than one way

that we could do that. Let me show you two different options we have.

In option number one, we could have the MCP server

reach out directly to Claude or some similar LLM

and ask it to summarize all the results that found

from the Wikipedia searches. So in this case, we

would be giving our MCP server direct access

to a language model. This would absolutely

work. It is definitely something we could do. However, this

adds a lot of complexity to our MCP server. We

would have to write in some amount of code to allow the MCP

server to make a request off to Claude, get the response back,

extract the generated text, and so on. We would also

have to make sure that the MCP server has an API

key to access Claude or whatever other language

model we were using. So again, option number one would

work, but it adds a decent amount of complexity.

So on to option 2. In option 2, we're

going to have our MCP server make use of the technique

referred to as sampling. With sampling, we're

going to have our MCP server ask the client

to run a prompt on his behalf. So

in short, the MCP server is going to write up a prompt,

send it off to the MCP client, and say, hey, could

you feed this into Claude for me? The MCP client

that we've put together isn't going to take that prompt and send

it off to Claude. It will get a response back and

then send the result of that text generation back

to the MCP server, where it can then do whatever it wants

to do with that generated text. This

approach moves the complexity over to the MCP

client. And in this case, it's kind of OK. Because

as you saw, our MCP client or that next JS

application already has an existing connection to

Claude. It is already making requests off to Claude. So

it's not that much more to just run one additional

request on behalf of the MCP server. The

other obvious benefit here is that the MCP server

does not need a API key to access Claude

at all. And if this is a publicly accessible MCP

server, now it doesn't need to worry about paying for

tokens generated on behalf of someone else making

use of the server. So this technique is referred

to as sampling. It allows a MCP server to

ask the client to run Claude or any other

language model to generate some amount of text. You

can really think of sampling as moving the responsibility

of calling Claude from a server off to the client.

Sampling is most useful anytime you're putting together a publicly

accessible MCP server. You don't want to have

a MCP server that is publicly available for anyone to use

that is just going to allow anyone to come and generate some text.

For your publicly accessible server, you would want to make use

of sampling and move the responsibility of generating

text from your server off to whatever

client is connecting to it. Making use of

sampling requires a little bit of setup on both the server

and the client. First off, on the server, inside

of a tool function, you will call the Create Message

function. And you're going to pass into that a list of messages

that you want to be eventually handed off to Claude. This

list of messages is going to be formulated into a request

that gets sent down to the client. Then on

the client, you have to write out a little bit more code,

specifically something called a sampling callback. I've

got an example sampling callback at the top of this code

snippet on the right-hand side. Your sampling callback

is going to receive the messages that were sent from the server.

Then inside this callback, it is up to you to call

a Claude or whatever other language model you are

making use of, generate some text, and then return

a create message result. All

right, so that is sampling. As you can see, it's not terribly

complicated. It's really just this concept or this idea

of shifting the burden of generating some text from the

server back over to the client. And again,

this is a technique you're definitely going to want to look at anytime

you're putting together a publicly accessible MCP

server.
