# The STDIO transport

## Transcript

As we discussed a moment ago, clients and servers communicate

by exchanging JSON objects that we refer to as

messages. Now, JSON in general

can be transmitted between a client and server in a wide

variety of different ways. For example, we can make a HTTP

request. We could use web sockets. We

could even write out a postcard with some JSON

and then send it to someone else and have them manually type that

JSON into a server. So there really are a tremendous

number of ways to send and receive JSON. In

the MCP spec, the thing that we used to actually move

JSON between a client and a server is referred to

as the transport. When you are initially

developing an MCP server or a client, a very commonly

used transport is the standard IO transport. The

idea with this transport is that our client is going to launch

a server as a separate process. By doing

so, the client has a handle on that process.

and the client can send messages into the server

by writing them into the server standard in channel. And

it can receive messages by watching the server standard

out channel. Something that is really nice

about the standard IO transport is that communication between the client

or the server can be very easily initiated on

either side. So in other words, at any point in time,

the client can communicate or send a message off to the server

by writing to standard in. And the server can communicate

back to the client by writing to standard out.

But the standard IO transport also has one big downside, and

that is that we can only make use of this transport when the

client and the server are running on the same physical machine. To

help you better understand the standard IO transport, let me give

you a quick demonstration. I put together a very

small MCP server. I've got some print statements

up here at the top just to help you understand what's going on. But

besides those print statements, the server doesn't really have a whole lot

to it. I'm creating a server, I'm defining one

single tool, and then starting the server up with the standard IO

transport. Now I could create a client

to connect to the server using the standard IOTransport,

but I can also just connect to the server directly

from my terminal without creating any distinct

separate client. Let me show you what I mean by that. If

I run UVRunServer.py right here, it's going to start up that

server. And now that server is going

to be listening to standard in and then writing

any outgoing messages to standard out. Well,

in my terminal, in case you don't know, whenever I run a program,

if I type anything down here, I am writing to standard

in of this running program. So I can actually

paste in JSON messages down here at the bottom, execute

them, and they will be received as input to the server.

So let me give you a quick demonstration of that. I'm going to restart

the server really quickly. And

then I'm going to copy this first example message up here. I'm

going to paste it right here. And it's going to occur almost

instantly when I hit enter. I'm going to immediately get

a response back. So I've written to standard

in right here with a message. And I am seeing a output

message on standard out right there. I'm

then going to send another message. Here

we go. And this time around, I'm not going

to see any response. And then finally, I'm going to run

one more message. down

here. And when I run this one, I'll immediately get

back one response, and then another response and another response

after that. So three objects in total. There's one,

there's two, and there's three. So

let me show you a couple of diagrams to help you understand what I'm really doing as

I paste these different messages in. Okay,

so back over here. On the left-hand side, I've got what

I have labeled my MCP clients, but really it's just me

at my terminal pasting messages in. By pasting

those messages in, I'm writing to standard in of the MCP

server. The server is then going to process these given messages

and then possibly send a result back by just

printing it to standard out, which I see directly

printed at my terminal. The first message that

I sent in was something called an initialize request.

Let me just give you a little bit of backstory here. Whenever a client

first connects to the server, the MCP spec says

that we must send a sequence of three different

messages back and forth. The very first message must

always be an initialize request. And again,

that is what I initially pasted in right here. That

was initialize request. Because

I sent in a request type message, I would

expect to get back a result. And that's exactly what happened.

I got back something referred to as a initialized result. So

that was that text right there. Then

the NCP spec also says that after

exchanging these initial messages, we must

then also send a initialized notification

from the client to the server. As a reminder, notifications

do not require a response. So I did

send in that initialized notification right there.

And as we noticed, we didn't get any immediate response

back. Again, that's just because notifications do not

require a response. Once we have exchanged

these three messages, our connection to the MCP server

is considered to be initialized. And at that point

on, we can then run call tool requests

or run prompt listing requests,

whatever else we want to do. So in my

case, as you saw, I sent in a call

tool request. That was the last one down here.

I attempted to call the add tool with arguments of

five and three. Now the way that I put

together the add tool, it is set up to send back a couple

of different logs and then eventually a called tool result.

So if I looked through the logs, I actually changed

it from what you see in that diagram. First, I got a message

notification. So a login statement that's coming

from right there. There's my login statement.

I then got a progress statement. So there's the progress

update right there. Those are both notifications being

sent from the server to the client. And then finally,

I got my call tool response right there, and

inside of it is the calculated result of adding

3 plus 5, I see 8. So

now that we've seen an example of the standard IO transport, there

are some really critical ideas that I want to point out

around this transport in particular that are going

to be very relevant or very important to understand as

we start to take a look at the streamable HTTP

transport. First, I showed you the diagram a little

bit ago. And I showed you this diagram to help you understand that there

are some message types that are intended to be sent from the client

to the server and some types that are meant to be sent from the server

to the client. The other thing that I really wanted you

to understand from this diagram is that there are some instances,

specifically with these messages on the top left-hand side, where

we can kind of imagine that the client is initiating

communication with the server. So in other words, the

client is saying, I am making a request and I expect

to get back a response. Likewise, there

are some situations where the MCP server is

sending the initial request off and expects to get

back a response. So that would be like the create

message request, which is what is used to initiate

sampling. So the server needs to send

off this request to the client and expects to get

back some kind of result. Now to put that in

slightly more clear terms, here's what

I really mean to indicate with that. There are

really four different scenarios with these different transports,

like the standard IO transport, that we need to be able to

handle. We need to be able to handle the initiation

or kind of a initial request from the client to the

server, and the transport needs to be able to handle

sending a response from the server to the client. Also,

the server needs to be able to send an initial request to

the client, and then likewise, the client needs to be

able to respond. So I want to walk

through all these four different scenarios and think about how

we would implement them with the standard IO transport. So

first is an initial request from the client to the server.

So the scenario here would be any time the client wants

to send something off to the server, like maybe a call

to a request or something like that. To implement

this with a standard IO transport, all we have to do

is write to standard in. And the MCP

server will receive that message, process it, and then hopefully

formulate a response. Once it has

a response, it would respond by just writing

a message to standard out. Now

the third scenario would be where we have an initial

request to be sent from the client to the server. So this

would be where maybe the server wants to do some sampling,

and that's going to require the server to send some kind

of initial message off to the client. Whenever

the server needs to send an initial request to

the client, all it has to do is write to standard out.

And then likewise, to respond, all the

client has to do is write to standard in. All

right, now I know that the last couple of minutes in

this video and the sequence of diagrams I just went over are

probably a little bit confusing. And you're probably thinking, what

is this about initial requests and responses and whatnot? Well,

here's the point. The whole point of all this is to help you understand

that the standard IO transport is really fantastic

because at any point in time, the client

or the server can initiate communication.

either one can send a request at any point in time and

expect to get back a response. Here's

the key thing. That is not going to be the case with

a streamable HTTP transport. There

are some scenarios where the streamable HTTP transport

does not allow for this situation.

There are some cases where the server cannot send some

initial request off to the client. And

that's the tricky thing to understand about the streamable

HTTP transport. So now we're going to

take a pause right here. Come back. We're going to start to take a look

at the HTTP transport. And we're going to see

this particular scenario and understand that, yeah,

there's something a little bit tricky about this that you definitely need

to understand when you are developing your own MCP

servers.
