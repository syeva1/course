# Log and progress notifications

## Transcript

Next up is logging and progress notifications.

These notifications are really easy to set up and greatly

improve the user experience around your MCP server.

So let me show you once again a quick demonstration. You

might recall the app I showed you just a moment ago with this research

application. And if I ask Claude to

generate a report on archeology, it is going to make a

tool call through that MCP server that we discussed a moment

ago. It's going to call specifically the research function.

Now, it takes a while for this research function to complete.

And as it is running, a user is not really getting any

feedback. So as far as the user knows, this tool

call might have actually failed, and it might just be in a

stalled state or something like that. So it

would be really nice if we could give users a little

bit more insight into what is going on behind the scenes.

To do so, we can make use of logging and notifications.

So let me show you what that exact same query would look like if

I turn on logging and notifications, which

I did when I just refresh the page right now. So I'm

gonna ask the same query again, and now I'm gonna get the

same research tool call, but now I'm going to

get a progress meter and some log statements to go along

with it. The progress and log meter is not

fake data. These are log and progress statements

that are being emitted inside of the tool call, inside

of the research tool. So let me show you a little bit of

code and help you understand how this works. To

get started with logging and progress notifications inside

of a tool function on our server, we'll receive the

context argument, which is automatically included as the

last argument to our tool function. On that context

object are a variety of different methods that allow us to either

log information or report the progress

of this tool run back over to the client. So we

get methods like info and report progress.

Anytime you call these functions, a message will be automatically

sent back to the client. To make use of the log

statements and the progress updates on the client, we'll write

out a little bit of code similar to what we saw just a moment ago around

sampling. So we'll put together a callback function.

They'll be called whenever we receive a logging statement

from the server. will also make a separate callback

that will receive updates on progress from the server. We'll

then take the logging callback and pass it off to our client

session and the progress callback and that gets passed

off to the call tool function. Inside

of these callbacks, it is up to you on how you're going to report

these log statements and the progress to your user.

You can just print them out at the terminal if you're making a CLI

application. If you're making a web app, you'll

have to come up with a little bit more clever solution to get that information

down to the browser. You, of course, also do not

have to actually include any of these log statements

or progress statements. You don't have to show them to the user at all if

you do not want to. These are just user experience

enhancements. Once again, to give your user a better idea

of what is going on.
