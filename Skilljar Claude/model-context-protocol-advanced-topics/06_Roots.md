# Roots

## Transcript

Our next topic is the root system. Roots

allow users to grant a server access to some particular

set of files and folders. You can really think of roots

as being like a codified way of saying, hey,

MCP server, you can access these files.

But roots do more than just grant permission. Let

me walk you through a quick example to help you understand

how they work. In this example, I'm going to first

show you a common problem that we would run into if

Roots did not exist. Once we understand the issue,

we'll then see how Roots solve that problem. So

in this example, we're going to have a very simple MCP server

with one single tool called Convert Video. This

tool is going to take into a path to a video file

on the user's local machine, and it's going to convert

that video file into some other file type,

so maybe a MP4 to a MOV.

Now let's imagine how a user would actually make use of this. A

user might type into to some CLI application or

something like that, asking Claude to convert

a biking.mp4 video file into

MOV format. Claude would then take a look

at the list of tools that are provided by this MCP

server and see that the convert video tool is available.

So Claude would probably decide, fantastic. I'm

going to call that tool and I'm going to pass in a path

of Viking.mp4. Because

that's exactly what the user asked for. The user asked

for a conversion of a video file named

Viking.mp4. And here's what

I would probably expect to see in response from that tool. I

would probably expect to see an error come back, saying

something like, there's no such Viking.mp4

file available. So why would I expect

to see that error exactly? Well, remember, the

user's file system might be really complex. They

might have a wide variety of different files and folders,

tons of different documents all over the place. So

a user might know that the Viking.mp4 file

is inside this movies directory, but there's no real

way that Claude would understand that. So

if a user just asks for Viking.mp4, Claude

doesn't really have the ability to search over the user's file system

and figure out exactly where that particular document is.

Now, one way that we could solve this would be to just require

a user to always pass in a full path

to some video file. So we might say, you know what,

if you want to use this tool, you must pass in a fully qualified

path, like movies slash Viking.mp4.

And now probably this would work,

but it's not super convenient. Users

don't really want to sit there and have to type out full paths

to every file they ever tried to access. They really probably

just want to put in something like convert this video and then just

put in the name to it to some other format.

So now that we understand the issue, let me show you how we could solve

it by using the idea of roots. So

we're going to solve this problem by adding in some additional tools

to our MCP server. We're so going to have the

same convert video tool, but we're also going to add

in a tool of read directory. I bet you could guess what

that does. It's just going to list up all the files and folders in

some specific directory. And then the third

tool that we're going to have is going to be called List Roots.

This is going to return back a list of roots. Our

root is a file or a folder that the

user has granted permission to be read ahead of time.

So in other words, when they first start up this MCP server,

they might pass in as command line arguments, a list

of files and folders that the server is allowed to read.

On top of that, we're also going to put in a little requirement

in our other tools. We're going to add in some code to

 our read directory tool and the convert video tool.

And we're going to make sure that whenever they try to access some directory

or some video file, they only get to access

files and folders that are contained inside

of one of these different roots. To help you understand

how these three different tools come together, I put together a very

small sample application. So let me give you a

quick demo right away. To run this program,

I execute uvrunmay.py. And

then the program is set up to accept a list of additional

command line arguments. So if I want to, I could put in desktop,

like so. And that's going to be set up as a root

inside the MCP server. So I'm essentially saying

that I want the server to be able to access the desktop

folder and all the files inside of it. Then

on the right-hand side over here, you can see my desktop directory

inside there is a file called Viking.mp4.

So now I'm going to run this, and I'm going to ask Claude

to turn the Viking.mp4

file into a MOV file. Now

I'm going to run that, and we'll see a couple of tool calls printed

out. First, Claude is going to take a look at all the

different files and folders that it can access by calling the List

Roots tool. It's then going to see that there's only one

directory that it can access, the desktop folder, because

that's the only one that I granted access to in this program.

It's then going to try to read that directory, and it's

going to discover the Viking.mp4 file

inside there. And so at that point in time, it now has everything

it needs to actually successfully run the convert

video tool. So it can run that tool with a

path of the fully qualified path to my desktop

folder, Viking.mp4. Now

remember, roots are intended to limit what files and

folders the MCP server can access. So in

addition to that desktop folder, I also have a documents

folder inside of here. Inside of that directory

is a swimming.mp4 file. So

now I'm going to ask Claude to convert the swimming.mp4

file into a MOV as well. And this time

around, I'm going to provide the full path to the MP4

file. So now in theory, Claude doesn't need to

take a look at the list of roots. It can just directly call

the convert video tool because it's already got a fully

qualified path to the particular file it wants to convert.

So I can run this and we'll see what happens. So

it's going to merely try to call a convert video, but it's going to return

early because Claude is going to say, sorry, but I

got an error around running that tool. It was not able

to find the particular file. Claude is then going

to try to take a look at the roots that are available. Read

the only root that is available, in this case, the desktop.

And then Claude is going to realize, hey, it looks like I actually

can't access that file at all. The only directory

I can access is desktop. And if you want me to convert

the swimming file, well, I just can't access

it. So try to give me access or move the file

or whatever else. Now, based upon that

demonstration, you might notice that roots really have two

distinct purposes. On the one hand, they

allow users to grant access to particular files and

folders. But on the other hand, the other really

nice benefit to them is that they allow Claude

to focus on just particular areas of your file

system. So as we saw, we don't have to put in fully

qualified paths to some particular directory or

file that we might want Claude to access. Instead,

Claude can autonomously decide to take a look

at the available roots and then search through those roots to

find some particular file. The

one thing that I haven't quite mentioned here, but is very critical

for you to understand, the idea of roots is kind

of loose. And there's not a tremendous amount of implementation

around them. So in other words, there's nothing inside

of any Anthropic SDK that will actually

automatically limit access to particular files

and folders. Instead, it is up to you

in your Anthropic server to make sure that whenever

a tool tries to access a file or a folder, it

is listed or contained inside of one of these different

roots. And you might do that by implementing a

function like you see on the top right-hand side here, something like, is

path allowed. Inside that function, it takes

in some requested path, it's then going to get a list

of roots from the client, and then see if the path

that the tool wants to use is contained within

one of those routes. And if it is, fantastic, we'll

allow access. Otherwise, nope, we're not going to allow

access at all. Now, the last thing I want

to mention is that I showed implementing a tool

of something like list roots and allowing Claude

to call that tool at any point in time. That is

not strictly required. You can also just take the

list of roots and toss them all into a prompt

manually. So you don't have to make that tool. It's just a pattern

that I found was kind of helpful for allowing Claude

to look at the list of roots whenever it decides it needs to figure out

what files and folders it can access.
