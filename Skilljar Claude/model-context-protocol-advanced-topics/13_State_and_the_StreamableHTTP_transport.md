# State and the StreamableHTTP transport

## Transcript

The last thing we need to do is understand what the stateless and

JSON response flags are all about. How do they affect our server

and when will we ever set them to true? I first

want to walk you through a scenario where we might want to set these things to

true because it really frames why these flags exist

and how they affect our server. Let's imagine that you

and I build an MCP server and we deploy it somewhere publicly

online, where anyone can connect to it. So maybe

we connect to it with our own client, and then some other

people connect to it with their own clients as well. Over

time, our server might become really, really popular, and

in addition to the three initial clients we had connected,

maybe many, many other people connect to it as well. At

a certain point, running a single instance of our server on a single

machine would probably not scale to the amount of traffic

that is incoming. So one way we might solve this is

through a little bit of horizontal scaling. With

horizontal scaling, we might run multiple copies of our server

and then gate access to them with a load balancer.

So any incoming request would be randomly routed to

one of these different servers. This would allow us to scale up to meet

higher demands of traffic. And let's think about

what would happen if we put a load balancer here, particularly

keeping in mind the fact that we want to have really

two separate connections to our MCP server from any given

client. First, we want to have that running get request

running at all times so we can receive requests from the

server to the client. And our client also needs to make

post requests and then receive a SSE response

with some number of messages inside of it as well.

So let's consider just one client connecting to maybe

two different servers. This client would then make an

initial request, setting up that initial Git

SSC response pipeline. So we then imagine

that we've got this response pending or kind of running continuously

down to the client. Again, remember this is all about allowing

a server to resend a request down to the client.

Then maybe at some future point time, the client decides to

run a tool. So it might make a call tool

request using a post request. And maybe

this request gets routed to the second MCP

server. The second server would then respond by setting

up its own separate SSC response. Now

at this point time, I'm not going to show the load balancer just for clarity.

As the tool runs inside that server, let's

imagine for a second that it needs to make use of Claude, and

it might try to make use of Claude by creating a create

message request. Remember that represents a attempt

to use sampling. Now, sampling requests always

need to go through the Git SSE response.

But that connection has been formed by a completely separate

server. So we would need to figure out some way to get

this request right here over to this other

server and have this server send the request down through

this Git SSC response, have the MCP

client run Claude, generate some text,

send it back to this server, and then somehow get

that generated text back over to this server.

As you can tell right away, coordinating all this would be

really, really challenging. Now, it absolutely could

be done, but it represents a lot of difficulty

and a lot of added configuration and infrastructure. So

if we are building an MCP server that we expect to

scale horizontally and we do not want to go through all

this extra coordination and infrastructure setup, we

might decide to set that stateless HTTP

flag to true. Setting this flag to true

has one immediate but very important effect.

It means that clients do not get a session ID,

and that means that a server can never keep track of a client.

Right away, that has some really big follow-up effects.

Without a session ID, the MCP server can no longer make

use of the Git SSC response pathway to

send requests down to the client. To understand why

that response pathway can't be used anymore, I'd encourage

you to think of a bank where you don't have any account

IDs. So a bank might receive money, but

it wouldn't really know who gave them the money, and it wouldn't really

know who to give money to because it doesn't know who is owed

what. That's the same situation here without any identifying

token. Now without that Git SSC

response pathway, that means that because our server can't

send any request on the client, we also can't use features

like sampling or progress logging or subscriptions

around things like changing resources and so on. There

is another upside to this, however. In stateless mode,

you do not need to go through client initialization anymore.

So that means that back over here inside of this

application, remember whenever we connect to the server, we

had to make that initialized request and then

the follow up initialized notification. When you're in stateless

mode, you do not have to make those two requests, which

definitely cuts down on the amount of traffic that your server is

receiving. So there is a pretty good trade-off

here. Now the other flag that we've been

discussing has been JSON response. Whenever

you set JSON response to true, that just means that the post

requests that you send down to the clients are not

going to have streaming enabled. And I can

give you a very simple and easy demonstration of what that

looks like. So over here, very quickly,

let me give you a reminder of how this application usually works. I'll

send the initialized request, initialize notification,

and then when I call the add tool

function, I'm going to open up that SSC connection,

and I'll first get back a message, and then the call

tool result. Now I'm going to very quickly flip

the JSON response flag to true. And again, that

means that all the responses that I get back are going to be just

the final result as plain JSON. There's

no streaming at all. So now I'm going to go through the same

process again. I'm going to run the initialize,

I'm going to run the notification and

now this time when I call the add function, I'm

not going to get those intermediate messages about

some logging or anything like that. Instead,

I'm going to get the final tool call result and

nothing else. So now if I run this, we'll

see that I'm not streaming response back. Instead, I'm waiting

until the tool call is complete and I get just

the result and absolutely nothing else. No log statements

at all. So you can see right away how these two

flags have a tremendous impact on how your server

behaves. But depending upon how you are

trying to develop and deploy your application, setting

these flags to true might be entirely appropriate. All

right, through a lot of patience and many different diagrams,

I think we've finally got a reasonable idea of how the streamable

HTTP transport works. So keep in

mind these two flags and exactly how they affect

your server. If you are developing your server in

development on your local machine using a standard

IO as your transport, when you deploy to production,

if you are intending to use the streamable HTTP

transport, just keep in mind that your server might behave

a little bit differently. So as you are developing your server,

I would encourage you to use the transport that you plan to

use in production, because it's going to save you a lot of trouble

down the line.
