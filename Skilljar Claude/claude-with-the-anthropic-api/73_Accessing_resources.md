# Accessing resources

## Transcript

We have defined two separate resources inside of

our MCP server. So now our client needs

the ability to request these resources. To

do so, we're going to add in a single function inside

of our MCP client. And remember, this

MCP client is going to have some functionality that we're

putting together that is going to be used by the rest of our application.

And I've already put together that code already. So somewhere

else inside this project, something is going to try

to make use of this function that we're about to add into

the MCP client. To get started, I'm going

to open up the MCP client file again. I'm

going to scroll down and find

read resource right here. So

our goal inside here is to read a particular

resource by making a request off to our MCP server

and then parse the contents that come back depending upon its

mime type and then just return whatever data

we get. So you'll notice that a argument

to it is the URI. This is going to be the URI of

the resource that we want to fetch from the server.

In order to make request, just to get all

of our types nicely, we're going to add two imports

at the very top of the file. I'm going to add in an

import for the JSON module. And from

PyDientTik, I will import AnyURL.

Then I'll go back down. to

our read resource function. I'm going to clear

out the comment in the return statement. Then I'll

get a result from calling await. self.

session. I want to read resource. And

then again, this is really just to get the types to work out. We're

going to put in an AnyURL with the input

URI. Then

I'm going to take from that result. response

or excuse me, result.contents

at zero. And I want to make this clear

right here why we were adding this in. So just a moment ago inside

of our inspector, we saw the response we get back. So

this is essentially that result variable. Result

has a contents list. And there's going

to be a list of elements inside there. We really only care about

the very first one. So I want to get the first dictionary.

I want to access the type property and the mime

type. I want specifically the MIME type because

it's going to help me understand what kind of data we got back. If

it is JSON, then I want to make sure I parse the text

as JSON and return that result. So let me show

you how we're going to do that. I'm going to add in a

if isinstance(resource.contents[0],

ResourceTypeText) and

resource.mime_type ==

"application/json": # This is our hint.

If the server told us that it's

giving us back some JSON, we need to make sure that we parse

the text content as JSON. So

I will return in that case json.loads(resource.text).

And then otherwise, if we don't fall into that if statement and return

early, I want to just return resource.text.

So in this scenario, we'd be returning the text as just plain

text or not parsing anything. So this would really

be the case in which we get back the contents of a single

document. All right, so

that should really be it. We've got our read resource

put together. Now again, I want to remind you, I

know I've said this several times, but I just want to remind you because I

think it might be a little bit unclear. The code that we're

writing inside of the MCP client is being used from several

other places inside of this code base. So

somewhere else in this code base, we're going to be calling that

function that we just put together to get the list of document

names and then eventually get the contents of a document

to put into a prompt. So at this point,

everything should essentially work because the rest of the work has already

been done for us. So with that in mind, let's

go back over to our terminal and we're gonna test out our CLI application

again and see if this mention feature works. Okay,

so back over here, I'll do a `uvicorn main:app --reload` and now I should be able to say something

like what's in the at and there

we go, I see my list of resources and I can use the arrow

key to scroll through. Once I am at a resource,

I like, I'll just hit space and we'll insert

that resource. So what's in the report.pdf document? And now, I can tell you

that everything is working as expected here. In other

words, the contents of this document is being sent off to Claude inside the prompt. So if I submit this,

I should see an immediate response and it's going to tell me what is inside

of Report PDF. So this time around, Claude did

not have to use a tool to read the contents of

the document. All right, so that is resources.

Again, we make use of resources to expose some

amount of information from our MCP server.
