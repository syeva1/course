# The server inspector

## Transcript

We have put together some functionality inside of our MCP

server, but we have no idea if it works, so it'd be really

great if we could test this out somehow. It turns out that

by using this Python SDK, we automatically

get access to an in-browser debugger, so

we can make sure that this server is working as expected.

Let me show you how to use it really quickly. Back inside

my terminal, I went to make sure that I have my Python

environment activated. Remember, the ReadMe

document goes into detail on the exact command to run

to make sure that you have activated that environment. Once

you are sure that it is activated, we'll run MCP,

Dev, and then the name of the file that contains

our server. In this case, it is MCPServer.py.

Once I run that, I'll then be told that I have a server listening

on port 6277, and I'll be given a direct

address to actually access it. I'm

going to open up that address inside my browser. And

once you go there, you'll see something that looks like this. This

is the MCP Inspector. Now right away, there's

something important I want you to understand here. This inspector

is in active development. So by the time you

are watching this video, what you see on the screen right now might

be very, very different than what I am showing. Nonetheless,

it's probably still going to have some very similar functionality.

On the left-hand side, you'll see a Connect button. That

is going to start up your MCP server, so that file

that we just edited. I'm going to click on

Connect, and then right away, we'll see a couple of different

things on the screen appear. I first want you to notice

the top menu bar up here. It lists out resources,

prompts, tools, and some other stuff. Again,

the UI might change by the time you watch this video,

so if you do not see this menu bar up here, all we are really

looking for here is some Tools section.

Once I click on Tools, I will click on List Tools,

and I'll see the name of the tools that we just put together.

If I click on one, the right-hand panel is then going to

change. And I can use this panel over here to

manually invoke one of my tools to make sure that

it is working as expected. So this

is how we can do some live development on our MCP

server without actually having to wire it up to a real

application. In order to use

the Read.Contents tool, all we have to do is put

in a document ID. If I go back over

to my editor and

go up to the docs dictionary right here, I can

copy one of these document IDs so I

will take out deposition.md. I

will put it in as the doc ID and then click

on run tool. I should then see run

tool of success with the contents of the document.

And that is it right there. I can verify it. So same

exact string is what I see right there. We

can use this same exact technique to test out the other

tool as well. So I will change over to

the edit document tool. Now I'll put

in my document ID. My

old string that I want to replace, how about replace the

word deposition? Actually, I have an easier word to type out.

How about just this? That'll be a little bit easier.

So my old string is this. Remember,

that is going to be case sensitive, and I'm going to replace

it with a report. And

if I run the tool, I'll then be given a success. Remember,

that tool does not actually return the document's

contents. It just edits the document. So

now to verify that the edit was done correctly, I

can go back over to the Read.Contents

tool, run that one again with the same document

ID, and I should see a report

deposition, and then blah, blah, blah. All

right, so as you can see, this MCP inspector allows

us to very easily debug an MCP

server that we are implementing without actually having to wire

the server up to an actual application. As

you start building your own MCP servers, I expect you'll

be using this inspector tool quite a bit. And we'll

probably use it a little bit more inside of this module, just

to make sure that our server development is going along pretty well.
