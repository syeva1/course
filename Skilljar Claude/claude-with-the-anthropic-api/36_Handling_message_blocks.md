# Handling message blocks

## Transcript

On to step three, we're going to call Claude with

his JSON schema and some user message. So

from our server, we're going to make a request off to Claude just as

we've been doing before, but now we're going to also include this

tool schema. This helps Claude understand that there is

a tool available to it. Let's go back over to our notebook and

we're going to try to make this request by hand without using any

of those helper functions we previously put together, like the

chat function. Okay, so back over here, I'm

going to go down and create a new cell. I'm going

to make an empty list of messages. I'm going to append

in there manually a new

message with a role of user and

a content of what is the exact time

formatted as our

minute seconds. Then,

underneath that, I'm going to do a call off to the clientmessages.create

function. So I get a response from clientmessagescreate,

all designate my model, my max

tokens, My

list of messages, and now we want to also include

this JSON schema that tells Claude that it has

a tool available to it. To do so, we'll include

a Tools keyword argument. This is going to be

a list, and inside of it is going to be all the different JSON

schema specs that we have created. At this point in time,

you and I have only created one, and it's called Get

Current Daytime Schema. So we're going to take that and

put it in right here. Then I'm going to print

out response at the very bottom and let's run this and see

what happens. We're going to get a response message

back here that has a structure that we have not quite seen before.

All the messages that we have ever received before would have a

content field that has a list and inside there would be

a text block. And as I mentioned many times

before inside the text block is the text that we actually

want to display to the user. But now that we are making

use of tools, this content list is going to be a little bit

different. So you might notice that inside the content list,

there's a second block called a tool use

block. So here's that entire structure right here. Let

me show you a diagram just to make sure this thing is really clear.

Okay, so this is our first experience with a multi-block

message. Remember, a message is either an assistant

message or a user message. We are often going to

have some amount of text stored inside of a message, and

that's what we've always seen previously. But in addition to

just text, there are other types of data that can be

stored inside of a message. When Claude decides to

make use of a tool, it's very often going to send us back an

assistant message that contains both a text block and

a tool use block. The text block is intended

to be some text that is displayed to the user to

help them understand what is going on. So in this

case, the text block might contain something like, I can help you

find the current time. Let me find that information for you. Then

in addition to this text block is the tool use block.

This tool use block is a sign to a UNI as

developers that Claude wants to make use of a tool.

The tool use block is going to list out the name of the tool

function that it wants to call. So in this case, Claude wants to

call the Get Current Daytime function we put together. And

then it also provides some inputs or essentially arguments

that we need to pass into that function. So the next thing

we're going to do as a part of this entire process is to find

the appropriate tool and actually run it. But before

that, there's something really critical that we need to

take care of around this idea of having a content

list with multiple blocks inside of it. Okay,

so here's just a quick reminder for you. At

this point in time, we have made a request from our server

off to Claude, and in that request we had a single user message

that also included a tool schema. We

have now gotten a response back. And inside this response,

there is the assistant message, and it has two separate blocks

inside the content list, a text block and a tool use

block. Now, there's something I want to remind you about

Claude. Remember that Claude does not store any message

history or anything about the conversation you are having.

If you ever want to maintain a conversation or a history with

Claude, you have to manage it manually. And what

this means is that when we eventually take this tool use block

and eventually call some actual function, we need to eventually

respond back to Claude. And when we do so, here's

the critical part, we need to make sure we include the

entire conversation history just as we've

been doing throughout the course. So we already have an idea

of how to do this. The only difference this time around is that

we need to make sure that we deal with messages that might have

multiple blocks inside them. So let me show you how we would

do this by hand. And then eventually a little bit later on

inside this section, we are going to go back to our helper

functions, specifically add user message and

add assistant message and make sure that these can support

messages that have multiple blocks inside them. Because right

now they only support single text blocks. Okay,

so to manage these messages, I'm

going to go back down to our bottom code cell where we are currently

getting our response. I'm going to take our

response and make sure I append in a new

assistant message to our list of messages. So

I'm going to delete response right there. We'll say messages

dot append. I'm going to put in a new

role of assistant. And

then our content is going to be the exact list

of content blocks out of the response we

just got back. So all we have to do is add in response

dot content. There

we go. So now if I print

out messages and run the cell again, We

should see that we end up with our user. So

that's our original message right there. We now have our assistant

message. And inside there is a text block and

the tool use block. So now we are correctly building

up our conversation history over time by including

all the different blocks from all these different messages that

we are collecting. So once again, I just want

to remind you that we are going to eventually have to go back to the add

user message and add assistant message, those

two helper functions, and update them to account for

dealing with multiple blocks like this.
