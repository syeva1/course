# Prompt caching

## Transcript

The next feature that we are going to focus on is prompt

caching. Prompt caching is used to speed up

Claude's response and decrease the cost of text

generation. To help you understand how prompt caching

works, we're going to walk through what happens inside of

Claude during a typical request that we make without

any kind of prompt caching enabled at all. So again,

this is just a normal request. And we've already

spoken a little bit about normal requests on the entire flow. But

don't worry, this time, I'm going to add in a little bit of detail on

what happens inside of Claude itself. As usual,

everything begins with us sending a message off to Claude.

And when Claude receives this message, before actually

generating any output text at all, it does a

tremendous amount of work on the input message.

In other words, Claude is going to internally create a tremendous

number of internal data structures and do a tremendous

number of calculations solely on the input

text. It will then eventually generate the output text

using all that earlier work it did, and then send

a response back to us in the form of some assistant message.

After the response is sent off to us, Claude is

going to then take the output text and the result

of all those earlier calculations that were done

on the input message and just throw them all into

the trash. A way it all goes, we see all that work

kind of go up in smoke entirely. Once Claude

has gone through all that cleanup, it declares the world I am

ready to process the next request. Now, let's

imagine for a moment that after making this initial request,

we then make a follow-up request. And in

this follow-up request, let's just imagine that we are continuing

this conversation. So we're going to attach

a list of messages. The first one will be the exact

same message we had sent in a moment ago, and

then the assistant message response we got back, and then some

new user message that we're going to attach just to further

the conversation along. So we're going to take all these

messages and send them into Claude. And internally,

Claude is probably going to be a little bit frustrated when

it sees that first message. Because Claude

is going to see that first message and think to itself, of course,

isn't quite what happens. We can imagine this is kind

of what's going on behind the scenes. Claude is going to see that first

message and say, I just saw this message.

I just did so much work to process it. And then I threw

away all those calculations. And Claude is

going to think to itself, I really wish I could reuse

all that work that I did just 10 seconds ago

and threw away. If Claude had saved

that work that it threw away just a moment ago, it would probably

be able to send us back a response much more quickly

because it doesn't have to repeat all that work. So

now that we have seen this problem, let's think of some

possible way to solve it. Well, here's one

possible way that we could handle this problem. Maybe

we could say that whenever we make an initial request

off to Claude, and Claude goes through all that initial work

on our user message that we are sending in, rather

than taking the results of all that analysis

and throwing into the trash, maybe we could instead cache

all that work or put it into some temporary data

store. Then if we ever make a follow-up

request and we include the exact same input

user message, Claude could go into its cache

and say, hey, I just saw this exact same

message a moment ago and I saved the work of

all the analysis around that particular message. So

rather than re-analyze the message again, it could reuse

all the work that it did previously. And hopefully this

would dramatically speed up the process of generating some out of text

because again, we are reusing some work that we

had already done. This idea of saving

some work from request to be used later on is exactly

what prompt caching is all about. So let's come back

in just a moment and we're going to walk through some of the implementation

details of prompt caching and really understand

how it is implemented by Claude.
