# Tool functions

## Transcript

Let's get started working on our first tool, which is going

to allow Claude to retrieve the current date time. Before

we go any further, I want you to know that I've created a new notebook

for you to use. This notebook is titled 001

Tools, and it is attached to this lecture. Inside

this notebook, you're going to find a lot of the same code we've already written out

inside the course. However, I've also added in

a new cell down here, titled Tools and

Schemas. Inside this cell, I've placed a tremendous

amount of boilerplate code just to save us a little bit of time

later on. In particular, you're going to find the add

duration to date time function, which you are going to use a

little bit later on. So again, I would encourage you to download

this notebook that is attached to this lecture and use it as the

starting point. All right. So now,

once again, we're going to be focused on implementing this first tool

of Git the current date time. I'm going

to walk you through this entire process step by step. We're going to

write out a lot of code inside of our notebook, and we're not

going to use any of those helper functions that we've set up inside

there. The ones like add user message and add assistant message

and so on. The reason for this is that you're going to see that we

need to refactor those functions just a little bit to

suit tools. So rather than trying to mix updating

those helper functions and learn about tools at the same time,

that would be really confusing. So we're going to instead just focus

on making a tool call without using any

helper functions as much as possible. OK,

so let's get to it. I've broken down this entire

process into several different steps. Step one,

whenever we are adding in a tool to our implementation, is

to write out a tool function. A tool function

is a plain Python function that is going to be executed

automatically at some point in time when Claude decides

that it needs to retrieve some extra information in order

to help the user in some way. I've got an example

of a possible tool function on the right-hand side called

get weather. Claude might be able to make use of this

tool function in order to retrieve the current weather at some

particular location in the world. Now there's

a couple of best practices around tool functions. First,

we always want to use well-named and descriptive

arguments. So the actual function itself and the

arguments to receive should be reasonably well-named

and at least give us a hint of what they are about. Second,

we want to validate these inputs and raise an error if

anything is wrong with the input itself. So for example,

if we failed to receive a location or if the location

is an empty string, we would want to raise an error immediately.

And then finally, whenever we do raise an error, we want to

make sure that it contains some kind of a meaningful error message.

In some cases, if Claude tries to call a tool

function, and it results in an error, Claude is going

to see the exact error message. And Claude

might decide to try to call your tool function again and

call it in a slightly different way that attempts to correct for

that error. So for example, you can imagine if that if

Claude tries to call this get weather function, and

it passes in an empty string, the validation

check at the very top would fail, and we would raise an

error. Claude would see the error message of location

cannot be empty. And Claude might then decide to try

to call this tool function again, making sure that it passes

in not an empty string anymore. All right, so

let's go back over to our notebook, and we're going to put together our first

tool function. Remember, the goal of the tool we are

putting together is to get the current date time.

So back over here, I'm going to add

a new cell at the very bottom and I will define a new

function called get current date time.

This is going to take in an argument that I will call date format.

I will give it a default value. It's going to be a little bit

of a complicated string here. I'm going to put in percent

capital Y, percent lowercase M,

percent lowercase d, and then a space,

a percent H colon, percent

M colon, percent S. Now

that string is a little bit complicated, so I would encourage you

to pause the video right here and double check the

string you've put in, make sure it exactly matches what I have.

Then inside this function, I'm going to use that date format

to get the current date time and format it in a way that

matches this date format string. So I will

return datetime.now.strftime, I'll pass in that

date format. So now as a quick example

of how we would actually use this function, we could call get

current date time. And if we ran it just like

this, we would get back a date time in the format of

year, month, day, hour, minute, second.

Or alternatively, I could put in a custom date

format string of something like percent

H, colon, percent, capital M. And

that will print out just the hour and minute of my

current time. A good improvement to this function would

be to add in some validation of the date format argument.

Unfortunately, we can't very easily validate the exact

structure. Make sure that this thing is a valid string format

time formatter. But we can at least check and make sure

that we are not passing in an empty string. So

I might decide to add in a little bit of validation here with

a if not date format.

And then if we fail that validation check, I might raise a value

error and say something like date

format cannot be empty. So

now if I try to call get current daytime with an empty

string, I would end up getting an error message and it's going to tell me

date format cannot be empty. Now to be

honest with you, it's kind of unlikely that Claude is going to

make this mistake of passing in an empty string here, but

at least from the off chance that it does, we are providing some

signal back to Claude and we are kind of telling it how

it can fix up the error. It can try to call get current

date time again and make sure that it passes in a date format

that is not empty.
