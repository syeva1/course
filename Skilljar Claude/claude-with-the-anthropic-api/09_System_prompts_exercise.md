# System prompts exercise

## Transcript

Let's go through a quick exercise on system

prompts. I've updated my notebook and I'm now asking

Claude to write out a Python function that is going to check a string

for duplicate characters. If I run this

and print out the answer, I'm going to see a tremendous

amount of code gets generated here. So some

of it is going to be a little bit of code, but there's also going to be a lot of explanation

and a lot of comments as well. So I would

like to go through an exercise here where we try to reduce

the amount of code that's being generated. I want to get

down to as concise and implementation of this function

as possible. To do so, I would like you to write out

a system prompt and pass it into the chat function call. Your

system prompt should assign a role to Claude and encourage

it to respond as concisely as possible. So

again, go ahead and pause the video here, go ahead and give it a shot,

and we'll go over solution right about now.

To solve this, I'm going to pass in a system prompt to

the chat function call. And inside that, I'm going to assign

a role to Claude that will encourage it to write very concise code.

I'll say you are a Python engineer who

writes very concise code. So

let's now run the cell and see what kind of response we get back

now. All right, that is definitely much more

in line with what I was looking for. You'll see that the actual

code we had to write to implement this uniqueness

check is very, very short, much shorter

than the code we saw a moment ago. Hopefully you had some

success with this exercise. And if you didn't, that is totally fine.

There are going to be many other exercises throughout the course where

you can test out your skills.
