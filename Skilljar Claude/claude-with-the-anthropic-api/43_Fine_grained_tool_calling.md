# Fine grained tool calling

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to take a look at combining together tool

use with streaming. You'll recall that we discussed

streaming from the API earlier. Streaming allows

us to give users a better idea of what's going on in our app.

So whenever we have streaming enabled and we make a request off

to Claude, we're going to get back some initial response,

and then we'll receive a series of different events. And each event

will have some additional piece of text that we might want

to display to the user. You might recall that there

are many different types of events that we might need to handle inside

of our application, and a very common one that we need to be

on the lookout for is Content Block Delta.

To make use of tools with streaming, we're

going to add in an additional type of event that we

need to handle. And it's called the input JSON

event. So now, if we turn on streaming and

try to make use of tools, Claude might send back a

new type of event to us called the input JSON

event. This object is going to have two

important properties on it. First, there's going to be

a partial JSON, which is going to be a piece

of JSON that represents a part of an argument

that Claude wants to send into our tool.

We're also going to get something called a snapshot, which is

a cumulative sum of all the different partial

JSON pieces that we have received so far. To

give you a better idea of how this works, I put together a new

notebook called 003 tool streaming. It's

attached to this lecture. This notebook contains a modified

run conversation function. It's going to use a new

function called chat stream to open up a response

stream from the Anthropic API. Then for

every chunk in that stream, we're going to process each

one depending upon the type of chunk it is. In the case

of receiving an input JSON chunk, all

we're going to do right now is print it out. So I'm going

to go down to the bottom where I've already put together a prompt along

with a new tool called save article schema.

I'm going to run this notebook and let's just see what happens.

Pretty quickly, we'll see each chunk of the response come in, including

the arguments for the tool call. You'll notice that this notebook

is also generating a scholarly article, just with

a few different properties compared to what we had previously. Now,

to be honest, there isn't really a lot more to tool streaming

beyond this. We really just need to make sure that we handle that

additional type of event. Having said that,

there is one other aspect of tool streaming that I

would like to tell you about, but it's around a very,

very particular feature that you might not ever need

to make use of. So let me give you a very quick overview,

and then you can decide if you want to hear about this very specialized

feature or not. If I rerun this notebook,

you might notice that it appears that we are getting streaming

behavior. Text is appearing chunk by chunk.

But for our tool call arguments in particular, you'll

notice that we have to sit around and wait for a few seconds.

And then all of a sudden, a giant chunk of text appears.

The fact that there's this really big delay and then we get a giant

chunk of text might not be a big deal to you at

all. However, you might be working on an application

where it's really important to show very precise

content updates to your users as soon as possible.

Or perhaps you want to receive portions of a tool call

as quickly as possible so you can start doing some processing work

as fast as you possibly can. So in the

remainder of this video, I'm going to help you understand why

there is that big delay and then a giant chunk of text

appears. And I'm going to show you a feature in the Anthropic

API to get rid of that delay. So let's get

to it. The first thing I would like to do is

clarify the tool that I have added into this notebook.

So I've slightly adjusted the tool that we had previously

that was generating a scholarly article. We're still generating

an article, but now it has a slightly different input structure

to it. I've got an example of the expected input

on the bottom left hand side. So we expect to receive a key

of abstract that's kind of like a summary of a scholarly

paper and a meta object. And the meta object

is going to have a word count and a review. And the review in

the theories can be some long review of the particular paper

that's been generated. Now, out of

this example input right here, there's something that I really just

want to examine really quickly or just kind of point out.

In this big object that we get, we're going to have two top

level keys. In other words, the top level keys inside

the entire big object. There's abstract

and there's meta. So we would refer to those as top level keys.

Meta is going to point to an object that has some additional

key value pairs inside of it, but again, the top level

keys are abstract and meta. So just keep then

your head for a little bit. So now I want to help you

understand what goes on behind the scenes inside the Anthropic

API whenever we generate some arguments for

a tool call in streaming mode. So it

doesn't quite behave as you might expect. In

this diagram on the top left-hand side, I've got our call being

sent off to the Anthropic API. Once it receives

our request, Claude will start to generate some JSON, which will

be the input to our tool call. The JSON isn't

generated all at once. Instead, it is created chunk

by chunk. Now, something kind of surprising

happens at this point. The Anthropic API

doesn't immediately take these chunks and send them right

back to our server immediately. Instead, it's

going to hang on to them for a little bit of time.

The reason for hanging onto these chunks is that Claude can sometimes

generate invalid JSON. So rather

than immediately sending each chunk to us, the API

is going to attempt to do a validation step, where

it makes sure that it is sending us valid JSON.

Let me show you how the validation step works. First,

as a reminder, we have two top-level keys for

our tool call, abstract and meta. So

the API isn't going to wait for the entire object to

be generated to do the validation. Instead, it

will wait for a single top-level key

value pair to be generated. So in the case of the

abstract key, the Anthropic API will

wait until it sees a closing quote for the abstract

value string. As soon as it sees that closing

quote on the very far right-hand side on chunk number four, then

the API knows that it has at least one key

value pair generated. In this case, the abstract

key value pair. The API will then attempt

to validate just that key value pair in isolation.

It's going to compare it against the JSON schema that we provided and make

sure that valid JSON has been produced. If

it is valid, then each of the original chunks that

were produced will be sent back down to our server.

Note that we do get each individual chunk, not

the entire key value pair as one single chunk. If

you're to log out all the different chunks that we receive inside

of our notebook, you will see that we do in fact receive a ton

of different individual chunks. They just all happen to arrive

at our server at just about the same time, because

the chunks have been buffered on the API

so that it can go through this validation step. Then

this generation process is going to continue with the meta

top level key. So once again, the API will wait

until the entire meta top level key value pair is

generated. It's then going to validate it and then

send us each of the individual chunks back down to

our server. So this is why, even with streaming

enabled, we end up getting these really big pauses

as the chunks are buffered on the API. And then all of a sudden,

we see a big group of chunks appear or

big chunk of text appear all at once, all of a sudden.

Now, again, this behavior might be okay for

you. You might not mind this buffering and validation step.

But if you are building a UI where you want to show users updates

as soon as possible, or if you want to do some tool

processing as soon as possible, then this big pause

might be a little irritating. Now, if that's the case,

I do have good news. There is a feature in the

API called Fine-Grained Tool Calling.

At its core, Fine-Grained Tool Calling does really just

one thing. It disables the JSON validation

step. So if you enable fine-grained tool calling, the

API will wait for Claude to generate a couple of chunk chunks.

It's going to join them together and then send that

big chunk down to your server. So this feature,

you will see a more traditional streaming output when

generating tool inputs. I do want to repeat

with fine-grained tool calling JSON validation on the

API is disabled. So your code running

on your server now really should assume

that you might be given invalid JSON and you should

implement some appropriate error handling. The

notebook that we were working on is set up for fine-grained tool calling.

So let's see what happens to our response when we turn it on.

I'm going to go down to the run conversation call right here and

I'm going to add in a fine-grained tool like

so. I'm going to run this. And

now we're going to see that when we eventually get down to the tool call, we're

going to get a lot more kind of classic streaming

experience here, where we get chunked by chunk just a little bit of text

at a time. So again, this would allow

us to process some part of the tool call much more quickly.

Let's say, for example, that the word count value right here

was really important to us. Without fine-grained

tool calling, we would have to wait for all this text

right here to be generated before we ever got

access to the word count. But if I run this again

with fine-grained tool calling, we'll see that now we can get that word

count value much more quickly. We don't have to wait for all

this additional text to be generated. Now,

you might be kind of curious what does happen exactly when

we get some invalid JSON generated. Well,

I put together a prompt that's going to

just about guarantee that we will get some invalid JSON

generated. I'm going to copy paste it in here really quickly. And

then I'm also going to add in an additional argument to the run conversation

function. Just make sure that we

do, in fact, get that invalid JSON generated.

So the extra argument I added on here is just a force tool

call. I'm forcing the model to always call the save article

model that we've put together. So I'm going to run this. And

we'll see that initially everything is going to go fine, but

then very quickly we're going to end up getting an error. So

the reason we're getting an error and what this prompt right here really

does, we just saw that word count value. So

word count is supposed to be a number. This prompt is

going to force a word count value of undefined.

And just so you know, undefined is not a valid value

in JSON. The equivalent JSON value would be

null. So if we ever get a value in JSON of undefined,

that would be invalid JSON. And we'd cause a parsing

error. And so that's exactly what we see down here. If

I scroll down a little bit more, I'll see an error something around. Yeah,

we've got some invalid JSON. And specifically is because

we got a word count of undefined. And

it might be kind of curious what would happen here if we were not

using fine-grained tool calling. You just might be a little bit curious.

So if I comment that out and I run this again. So

now the validation step is going to occur. So let's see how

this gets treated. So what the API

ends up doing here is it's still going to put in that

meta object. But instead of actually being an object,

it's going to wrap the entire thing in a string. So

now technically, we're really not following the JSON

spec in the response here. Our JSON schema,

the one we provided, said meta must be an object that

had a word count that's a number and a review that's a string. So

now meta is a string instead of an object. All

right, so let's wrap things up. Once again, tool streaming

by itself, not too crazy. We can easily add

it into any kind of streaming pipeline you might have already

put together. With default tool streaming, if you're

generating a large top-level key-value pair, there

will be a delay in that generation because the API

does some validation step. And if that's a big deal to you,

you can always turn on fine-grained tool streaming, which

is going to give you a little bit more classic streaming experience,

but at the cost of that validation step.
