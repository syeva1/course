# Chaining workflows

## Transcript

The next workflow that we're going to take a look at is going to seem

a little bit obvious and simple, but trust me,

this actually ends up being one of the most useful workflows around,

specifically in one particular situation that you're going to

run into very often. So let's get to it. Let's

change up our application a little bit once again. We'll

imagine that we are building a social media marketing tool. Users

will be asked to enter a topic for when their social

media accounts, kind of what the focus of their account is.

Then the goal of our application is to generate

and post some videos to their account. So

here's how we might actually implement this. We

don't really need a fancy agent with a ton of fancy

tools to implement this. We can build out a workflow

that will just go through a series of predefined steps one

by one. So in step one, we might take whatever

topic the user entered into that form and do a search

for trending topics on Twitter. We

could then take the list of topics and feed them all into

Claude and ask Claude to select the most interesting topic.

Then we could do a follow-up request to Claude asking to do some web

research on the topic. Then once the research is

complete, we could ask Claude to write a script for a short

format video. Once we have the script, we could then use

an AI avatar and some text-to-speech program

to create an actual video and finally post that video

off to social media. This is an example of a

chaining workflow. In a chaining workflow, we take

one large task, which was initially to generate

some videos and post them to social media, and we break it up

into a series of distinct steps. In our case,

the subtasks were the individual calls that we sent off to

Claude. We could have attempted to accomplish all three of these

tasks inside of a single call off to Claude. So

we could have just fed in a list of topics to Claude, asked

it to select the most interesting topic, and research

the topic, and write a script inside of a single prompt.

But by breaking this up into three separate calls,

we allow Claude to focus on just one individual task

at a time. Now, like I said, this probably

seems like a kind of simple and obvious workflow,

maybe not even worth discussing because it might be something you've already

implemented in the past. But there's one very

particular reason that I point out this workflow in particular

because it actually ends up being on the most important

workflow to understand to get quality outputs out

of Claude consistently when using rather large

prompts. So let me walk you through a little scenario.

You might not have encountered this before, but I

can almost guarantee that you will at some point in time. Let's

imagine that you are making use of Claude to write an article on

some given topic. You might initially just send

in a very simple prompt to Claude and ask it to write an article,

and then you might get back some results, and although it might be okay,

there might be some aspects to it that you don't like.

So you might initially find that Claude might be mentioning the

fact that it is an AI authoring the article, which you

probably don't want. It might make excessive use of

emojis, which you might not want. And it might use a little

bit cliched language all over the place, which, again,

you might not want. And so over time, as you

start to develop this prompt, you might eventually set

up a big long list of things that you tell Claude

to just not do it all. But inevitably, Claude

might eventually, no matter how many times you repeat these items, Claude

might give you back a response that seems to somehow always

use emojis, mention the fact that it

has been written by an AI, and just generally have

kind of a cringey, non-professional tone to it.

And Claude might persist in writing an article like this, no

matter how many times you repeat these constraints or things

that Claude should not do. So to address this

problem, you can use a very simple prompt-chaining workflow.

Here's what you might do. You might feed in that initial long

prompt that has all these constraints in it, and then just

accept that you are going to get back some initial article that doesn't

really fit the bill of what you're looking for. Claude might

inevitably decide to violate some of the different constraints you

laid out. To fix those issues, you could

then make a follow-up request back to Claude, providing

the article that Claude just wrote. And underneath

the article, you could ask Claude to rewrite the article in some

particular way. So you could say, find any location

where the author identifies as an AI and remove

that mention, find and remove all emojis, and

then write the text in a way that a professional technical

writer would do it. By using this chaining workflow and breaking

the task up into multiple steps, you allow Claude

to focus much more on each individual task

presented to it. So even though it might not really

satisfy all the requirements you put into the long prompt

originally, the follow-up prompt allows Claude to focus

on just the restrictions that you really care about, and

will hopefully rewrite the article in a style that you are

really looking for. So once again, even though prompt

chaining seems like something kind of obvious and simple, this

does end up being something that you're going to use rather often,

anytime that you have a task for Claude with many constraints,

and Claude doesn't seem to be always following those constraints as

much as you might expect.
