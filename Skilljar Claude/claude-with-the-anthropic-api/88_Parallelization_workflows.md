# Parallelization workflows

## Transcript

Thank you. Let's take a look at another workflow. We're

going to change up our application a little bit this time around.

We're still going to ask the user to drag and drop an image of

a part onto the screen. But this time, we're going to give

the user back an analysis, a report that's

going to tell the user the best material to build their

part out of, depending upon some various criteria.

To implement this feature, we might take the user's supplied

image and send it off to Claude along with a short prompt.

And in the prompt, we might ask Claude to decide whether it would

be best to make this part out of metal, polymer ceramic,

and so on. Now, this would probably work, but

we are really asking a lot out of Claude in this very

simple prompt. For example, we haven't really told Claude

any of the real considerations that it should take into account

when deciding which material to use. So, even

though this might work, we might not get the best results.

So a natural improvement here would be probably to go

back to this prompt and add in a lot more detail. Maybe

tell Claude some of the different scenarios in which it should recommend

metal or polymer and so on. So we might

end up with a really, really large prompt like

this. We might give some criteria for deciding when

to use metal and then some criteria for deciding when

to use polymer and then repeat with ceramic composite

last mere wood and so on. We would end up with a

really, really large prompt that might end

up being a little bit confusing to Claude because it has to do

a lot of analysis and a lot of work inside of one

single step. So this might not lead to the best

results. Let me show you a better way to approach implementing

this feature. We could decide to make a series

of different requests in parallel off to Claude whenever a user

initially submits an image. Each individual request

could then include a specialized prompt asking Claude

if making this given part would be a good idea using

metal or polymer or ceramic or composite

and so on. So in each separate request, we are asking

Claude for the suitability of building this part in one

individual material. With this approach, we

could specialize each individual prompt for the given material.

And now, Claude doesn't have to worry about all these different materials.

It's really just focused on one individual material at a time.

Now, when we eventually get some responses back from Claude, I'm

going to change the structure of this diagram just a little bit so I can fit everything

on one screen. So we're going to get back these individual

analysis results from Claude. Each one is going to tell

us the suitability of building out the given part in, say, metal,

polymer, ceramic, composite, and so on.

We can then take each of these analysis results and

then feed them back into Claude in a follow request and

ask Claude to consider each of the different analysis results

and decide upon a final material to use. Now,

Claude doesn't really have to worry about comparing all these

different materials up front. Instead, it can just take a look at

the analysis results that seem to be the most promising.

This is an example of a parallelization workflow.

The idea behind a parallelization workflow is that we're going to

take one task and break it up into multiple different subtasks.

Each of these subtasks can be ran in parallel, so at

the same time. We will then take the results from all

those different subtasks and then join them all together in

a final aggregator step. In our case,

the aggregator was this final step with Claude right

here. So we fed the results of each parallel

task into the aggregator and Claude gave us this final

recommendation. There are several benefits to this workflow.

First, it allows Claude to focus on one task at a

time. So remember just a moment ago when I told you that we

could feed the original image part into Claude with a

really large prompt that listed out some criteria for

many different material types. In this scenario, Claude

might get a little bit confused or distracted as it tried to consider

all the different pros and cons of each material simultaneously.

The second benefit is that we can very easily improve and

evaluate the prompts that are being used inside of each subtask.

Finally, this flow can generally scale very well.

We can add in additional subtasks at any point if we want

to without really subtracting from the other subtasks

that are being executed.
