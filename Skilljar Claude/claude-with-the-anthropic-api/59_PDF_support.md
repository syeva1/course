# PDF support

## Transcript

Besides images, Claude can also read content

directly out of a PDF file. I'm going to show you how you

do that in this video. Attached to this video, you will

find a document called earth.pdf.

If you open it up, you'll see that it's just a couple of pages out of

the Wikipedia article on Earth. So make

sure you download this PDF file and place it inside the same

directory as your notebook. To read a PDF

file, we use almost the exact same code that we use for

reading an image and feeding the image into Claude. So

I'm going to find where we are currently opening up an image right

here, and I'm going to change it to earth.pdf.

I'm going to rename this variable from image bytes to

how about file bytes, because no longer are we reading

an image. I'm going to make sure I update the variable down here

as well. I'm going to change the

type right here from image to document, and

then the media type will go from image slash

png to application slash pdf.

And then finally, the question that we're asking of Claude

about this document, rather than feeding in our big

prompt that we have in the previous cell, I'm going to ask Claude to

summarize the document in one

sentence. And let's see what we get out of Claude. So

I'm going to run this. And there's

the summary. It looks like it successfully read the contents of

that PDF file. Now, Claude has the ability to

not only read text out of a PDF, it can also read

images or charts, tables, and so on. So

you should really think of Claude as being like a one stop shop

for extracting just about any kind of information out

of a PDF document.
