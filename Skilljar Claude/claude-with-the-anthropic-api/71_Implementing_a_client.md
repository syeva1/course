# Implementing a client

## Transcript

Now that our server is in a good place, we're going to shift gears

a little bit and start working on our MCP client.

The client can be found inside the MCP client.py

file inside the root project directory. Now before we do

anything inside this file, I just want to give you a very quick reminder

here. Remember what I told you about earlier. Usually

in a typical project, we are either making use of a client

or we are implementing a server. It's just in this

one particular project that we are working on that we are doing both. Again,

just so you can see both sides of the puzzle. Now

the MCP client itself inside of this

file is consisting of a single class. You'll notice

there is a lot of code inside of here and it doesn't look quite as

pretty as some of the code we just wrote out inside of the server.

So let me tell you exactly what's going on inside this file and exactly

why it is so large. Okay, so

inside this file, we are making the MCP

client class. This class is going to wrap

up something called a client session. The client session

is the actual connection to our MCP server.

This client session is a part of the Anthropic

Python SDK. So again, this session

is what gives us this connection to the outside server.

The session itself requires a little bit of resource cleanup.

In other words, whenever we close down our program or decide

that we don't need the server anymore, we have to go through a little bit of

a cleanup process. And I have already written out

a lot of that cleanup code inside of the MCP

client class. So that's really why this class

exists at all, just to make that cleanup a little

bit easier. You can see some of that cleanup code inside

of the Connect function and down a little bit lower.

at the cleanup, async enter, and async

exit functions as well. So it's very common

practice to not just make use of this

client session directly, instead very common to

wrap it up inside of a larger class that's going to manage some of

this different resource stuff for you. The

next thing I want to clarify is why this client exists

at all. So in other words, what is the client really doing

for us here? Well, remember, this full that

we looked at a little bit ago. So we had our code right

here. And at certain points in time, we needed, say,

a list of tools to send off to Claude. And then later

on after that, we also needed to run a tool

that was requested by Claude. In order

to reach out to our MCP server and get this list

of tools or to run a tool, that's where we

are making use of the MCP client. So we can imagine

that this client is exposing some functionality that

belongs to the server to the rest of our codebase. So

inside of our codebase, inside this project, specifically inside

of the core directory, there is a lot of code already

inside there that I put together that is making use of

this class. So there is some other code that's going to

call Some of the different functions you see inside of here,

like list tools, call tool, list prompts, get prompt, and so

on. For right now, in this video, we're going to focus on implementing

two functions, list tools and call tool.

So as you just saw in the diagram, we looked at a moment ago, these

two functions are going to be used in different parts of our code base

to get a list of tools to provide off to Claude, and

then eventually call a tool whenever Claude requests to call

a tool. Implementing these two functions is going to

be really simple and straightforward. So let me show you how we're going

to do it. We'll first begin with list tools. I'm

going to remove the two do inside there and replace

it with result is await self.session.

I'm going to call that like a function list underscore

tools. And then I will return result

dot tools. And that's it. So

this is going to get access to our session, which is our

actual connection to the MCP server. It's going to

call a built-in function to get a definition or a list

of all the different tools that are implemented by that server. I'm

going to get back result and then just return the tools and

that's it. Then we can implement call

tool right here in a very similar fashion. So this will

be return a

waitself.session, call

tool, tool name, and tool input.

Once again, getting access to the session, that is our

connection to the server, and I'm going to attempt to call

a very specific tool, the name the tool we passed in,

along with the input parameters or input arguments to it, that

were provided by Claude. Now, at this point

in time, I would like to test out these two functions really quickly.

To do so, we're going to go down to the bottom of this file, where

I put together a very small testing harness for us. So

down here, you'll notice I put together this

testing block, so we can run this MCP

client.py file directly. And if we do so, we're

going to form a connection to our MCP server, and

then we can just run some commands against it and just see what we get

back. Notice that in your version of the code,

there's a comment in there about changing the command and args

right here in case you are not making use of UV. So

if you're not using UV, make sure you take a look at that comment.

Inside of this with block, I'm going

to add in a little bit of testing code. So I'll

say result is await underscore

client list tools. And

then I'm going to just print out the result that we get

back. So this should start

up a copy of our MCP server, then

attempt to get a list of all the different tools that are defined

by it, and then just print out the result. To

test this out, I will flip back over to my terminal and

do a UV run, MCP underscore

client.py. And as usual, if you

are not making use of UV, you'll just do a Python

MCP client.py. Okay, so I'll run

that, and there is our list of tool

definitions. So I can see inside of here that I have the read.contents

tool, which we put together a little bit ago, and our edit

document tool as well. Each one has a description

and a input schema as well.

So this is our tool definition, which will eventually

be passed off to Claude. Now before we move on, there's

one other thing I want to test. Remember, we

just implemented the function that's going to allow us to

list out some tools and pass them off to Claude and

the function that's going to allow us to call a tool that is implemented

by the MCP server and then pass the result off to Claude

as well. I have already implemented the code that is

going to call list tools and call tool

for us somewhere else inside this project. So now

that we have added in this functionality, now that we have defined

these tools and the ability to call a particular tool, we

can now run our CLI again and attempt

to get Claude to make use of these tools. In other

words, we can ask Claude to inspect the contents

of some particular document and even edit a document.

So let me show you how we do that. Inside of my

MCP server, I just want to give you a reminder that there is

a document with a ID of report.pdf,

and it has some texture of something like a 20 meter

condenser tower. I'm going to go back over

to my terminal, and I'm going to run

my project with a UV run main.py.

And then I'm going to ask Claude what is the contents

of the report.pdf document.

And make sure you put in exactly report.pdf

here. And when we run this, we're

sending off along with the request our list of tools.

Claude is going to decide to use the read document tool.

And it's going to get the contents of the document. And then we will see

that yes, Claude was able to get the contents of

that document. We are told that the report is something

about a 20 meter condenser tower. All

right, so at this point, we have added in some functionality around

our client. Remember, the client is what allows

us to access some functionality that is implemented inside

of the MCP server. At this point in time, we have

been able to list out some tools that are created

by the server and execute a tool that has been implemented

by the server.
