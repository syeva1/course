# Exercise on prompting

## Transcript

Let's test your knowledge of prompt engineering by going through

a quick exercise. Now for this exercise,

I made a new notebook called 003 underscore

exercise. You do not have to download this one.

All I did was replace the task description, the

prompt input spec, and then adjusted

some of the extra criteria down here. So if you want to,

you could manually change all the stuff in the notebook you're working

out of, or alternatively just download this 003

exercise and get caught up with exactly where I am.

Your goal in this exercise is to improve an existing

prompt using all the prompt engineering topics we've learned about

inside this module. The dataset you're going to be

working with is going to create a series of

passages of text from a scholarly

article. The goal of your prompt is to

take in that passage of text and extract all

the topics from it into a JSON array

of strings. And when I say topic, I really just

mean, well, what does this article talk about?

So if it's an article about, say, solar panels, I

would want to get back a JSON array of strings that contains

solar panels inside of it, only with any other topics

mentioned inside that text. The only

input to the prompt is going to be a content property.

So that's going to be one paragraph of text. Now,

in my notebook that I've opened right now, I have already executed

the cell and generated a dataset. I

have already put together a starter prompt for

you, and right now it's a very poor prompt that can definitely

be improved quite a bit. So go ahead

and play around with this prompt and use some of the different techniques

we have learned about. In order to evaluate your progress,

go ahead and run the cell down here. I've already included

a couple of extra criteria to make sure that you're kind of

achieving the correct result. Remember,

whenever you run the evaluation, you can always open up

that report.html file and get a better understanding

of what's going on. By default, with that really

simple prompt, I've got an average score of 2.8.

And so I'm hoping we can at least get that average

score over maybe seven or so. As

usual, I would encourage you to pause the video right here and

go ahead and give this exercise a shot. Otherwise,

if you want to stick around, I'm gonna go over a solution right

away. All right, so to solve this, we

know without a doubt all the work we're going to be doing is

focused on this variable right here. We need to

improve this prompt in some way to get back some better

outputs. The first thing we might do here is

make sure you run the evaluation at least one time to

generate that output.html file. And

then once you have created that file, I would encourage you to open it up and

take a look at some of the reasoning on why the

output has been graded so poorly. You'll

notice a common theme between each of these. A real

common theme right away that we can see is that, well, it

doesn't like the fact that we are not returning a JSON

array of strings. To solve this problem, let's make

use of that technique of being simple and direct inside

of our prompt. If we expect to get back a JSON array

of strings that contains all the topics out of this content,

well, we need to be very simple and direct with Claude

and tell it exactly what we want. So I'm going to

update the first line of the prompt right here and I'll say extract

key topics mentioned from a passage

of text from a scholarly journal

into a JSON array of strings

as simple as I can phrase it and as direct as

I can possibly make it. And right away, if I

rerun the prompt with the evaluation, I

will see that I get up to a kind of shocking 9.5

almost immediately. So I kind of didn't really expect

it to go that well because there are still some other techniques

we might want to try out here. But if we take a

look at the report now, I'm definitely getting back this JSON

containing all the different topics mentioned. And it looks like

the model grader is extremely happy with this output.

Now, I don't really want to leave it here. Obviously,

there are some other techniques we can add in to make sure

that we get the correct kind of output. So the next

technique we might add in is structuring our

prompt a little bit better by using some XML tags.

Before and after the content that we're going to interpolate

in right here, I'm going to add in some XML tags

and I'm going to give them the name of simply text.

Now in this case, I'm choosing to call these tags

text because I earlier referred to some text

inside of the first line of the prompt. So now we

have just a little bit more clear connection between

us talking about a passage of text right here and

us providing the text right here. Another

improvement that we might add in is to be very specific

in what we want Claude to do. So I could put in

a series of steps for Claude to follow. Let's

try that out. I might say follow these steps

and then list out exactly what I want Claude to do

step by step. So we might say closely

examine the provided

text. Identify

each topic mentioned, add

each topic to a JSON array,

and then finally respond with the JSON

array. Do not provide any

other text or commentary. Now,

if you wanted to also add in an example using one

shot or multi-shot prompting, absolutely feel free

to do so. But we already have some pretty good scores,

so I think this is probably enough. I'm going to read on

this prompt. I'll then run the evaluation

again and I end up getting a 9.5 again.

So I would say that this is a pretty strong prompt and I

would definitely trust it to extract a list of topics

from an article.
