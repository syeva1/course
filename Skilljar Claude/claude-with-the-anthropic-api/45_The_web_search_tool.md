# The web search tool

## Transcript

There's another tool built directly into Claude

named the web search tool. As the name

implies, this tool allows Claude to search the web

for up-to-date or specialized information to answer

a user's question. For example, if we ask about

current events in quantum computing, Claude might decide

to use this tool to find some up-to-date articles related

to quantum computing and then use that content to

formulate an answer. Unlike the text editor

tool, we do not have to provide an implementation

to actually run the search. The search is done entirely

by Claude, and this makes this tool really easy

to run and use. Let's write out some code to

understand how this tool works. I'm back inside of a

notebook. I've created a new one called 006 web

search. And I've got a cell down here at the bottom with some typical

code for running a request off to Claude. In

the cell right above, I'm going to create a new variable called

web search schema. This is

going to be a schema that we author that we are going to include

in our request off to Claude, and we're going to list

it as a tool. This schema is going to enable

the web search functionality. So just like the text editor

tool, we have to provide this very small schema that

behind the scenes is going to get expanded into a much larger

schema. We're going to add in a couple of fields here,

in particular a type with web

search_2025-03-05

then a name of web_search, a

max uses of five, and

that's it for right now. Now the max uses is

the number of times that Claude can run a search.

A single search can return multiple different search results, but

depending upon the content in those search results, Claude

might decide to do a follow-up research. This

process can repeat several times, so we are capping the number

of times that Claude can search in total to just five.

I'm going to go down here after running

that cell. And I'm going to ask Claude what's

the best exercise for gaining

leg muscle. And I'm going to add

in that schema that we

just put together. So web search schema

like so. Now I'm going to

run this, and it's going to take a little bit of time to

get a response back. The response we get back

is going to be quite large, so I can scroll through

it here, and we're going to see that there is just a tremendous amount

of information here. So to help you understand the response we

got back, I want to show you a little part-down version

of this response, where I took this messages,

content list, and I removed a ton of content out of

it just so we can better understand what is going on. So here

is a slightly redacted form. Again,

this is the content list inside the response message.

The content list is going to contain several different blocks, several

blocks we have not seen before. Initially, we

get back a text block, which is kind of framing the entire

response that Claude is giving us. Claude is saying that it's

going to do a web search to better understand how to answer

the question. Then we're going to see a server

tool use block. And inside there is the

input to the search tool. We can see that's the exact

query that Claude is going to use to search the web.

After that, we're going to see a listing of web

search tool result block, and inside there are going to be many

different web search result block. These are

the different search results that Claude has received

from that initial query. Now, an actual query

response will probably have many different search results. In this

case, I removed all of them, but one, just to better understand

what's going on here. So this is an actual web

search result. We can see the title of the page that

Claude fetch, and the actual URL. There's

no content inside of here just yet. This is just telling us

exactly what Claude found when it did this search.

Then Claude is going to begin by answering the user's question.

And it's going to answer the user's question with a variety of different

text blocks that might include a citations list.

The citations list is text that is supposed to support

the statements that Claude is making in some way. So

in this case, Claude has cited some particular web

page right here. And it is using this specific

text to support the point or the argument

that it's trying to make. When we define the web

search schema, there are a variety of different fields that we can add

in. There's one field in particular that I really

recommend you consider using if you ever have a good understanding

of exactly what your users are going to be asking

about. So in our case, we asked about

the best leg exercises for gaining leg muscle.

I don't know if you've ever searched online for exercise advice,

but there are a tremendous number of blogs out there

with probably just AI-generated content. And

the advice that you get out of those blogs might not actually

be the most accurate, or even the best idea of how to actually

gain leg muscle. On the other hand, there

are some websites that collect different publications such

as PubMed. So this is a website maintained

by the US government. It contains a ton of

different scholarly articles around medicine. So

we could search through here and find a tremendous amount of evidence-supported

exercise advice. So it would be really

fantastic if we could somehow tell Claude to only search

this web page and content inside of it. That would

allow us to make sure that we are giving the best possible advice to

our users and not just some randomly generated stuff

that we found online. In order to get Claude

to only search this page, we're going to find the domain,

which is nih.gov. I'm

going to go back over to my notebook. I'm going to find my web

search schema, and I'm going to add in an additional field here

of allowed domains. I'm going to put in

a list with NIH.gov. This

is going to constrain Claude Search to only that

domain right there, and it won't try to find anything else. So

now if I run this cell again, and then

make my request off to Claude again, I'm going to have to wait

for the response to come back. But when we

do get a response, we should be able to scroll through it a little bit

and eventually see that we have a URL right

here. And we should only have URLs belonging to the NIH.gov

domain. We shouldn't see anything else. So again, this

will allow us to make sure that we are giving at least some scientifically

supported advice to our users. Now, last

thing I'm going to do is show you exactly how we are really intended

to use this giant list of different types of blocks

that we get back when we make use of this tool. The

thought process here is that you're going to render all

the text blocks as plain text, and then

whenever you get a web search result block or

a citation web search result location,

you might render those out inside the UI in such a way that makes

it obvious to a user that you are trying to support your information

in some way. Here's an example of how you might do that.

I wrote out a small page that is going to take all

those different blocks we saw inside the response message and render

them out. At the very top right here, I've got a list

of all my web search tool result blocks.

So these are the different pages that Claude found when it did the web

search. I'm then going to iterate through the entire

list of blocks and show the text out of every single

text block. Whenever I found a text block

that has a citation web search result

location, I know that's a long term, so

it's one of these right here. Whenever I find

one of those, I might render it with a little citation

like so, where I'll show the domain, show the

title of the page that I found, show the exact address

of it, and then the exact cited text as well.

Again, this just allows our users to better understand

how Claude is actually getting its information.
