# The full RAG flow

## Transcript

At this point in the module, I've given you a high-level overview

of how that rag pipeline works. We've spoken a little

bit about text chunking, and we've got just a taste

of text embeddings. So now we're going to take these three

different topics, our high-level overview of the rag

process, text embeddings and text chunking, and

we're going to merge them all together and really understand the

entire rag pipeline. So we're going to go through a

complete rag example and go through a lot of

detail and really understand everything step by step.

So let's get to it. Step number one, just as

before, we're going to take some source document and chunk

it into separate pieces of text. So for this example,

I'm going to assume I just have two pieces of text here,

just section one, medical research, and section two,

software engineering. Step two, we're

going to generate embeddings for each of these different chunks

of text. Now in this example, we're going to pretend

that we have this imaginary super perfect embedding

model. And this embedding model has two very

important characteristics. First, we're going to assume that always

returns embeddings of length two, so just two separate

numbers. And we're going to also assume that we know

exactly what each number is really scoring

about the source text. Remember, in reality, that's not

the case. But in this scenario, we're going to imagine we know exactly

what each number is really talking about. So we're going to say

that the first number is how much the text is

talking about the medical field, and the second is how

much the text is talking about software engineering.

So for the first chunk of text, when we embed it,

this thing is definitely talking about medical research. So

I would give it maybe a score of .97 to say, yes,

absolutely, this is very much talking about the medical field.

And then it also uses the term bug, which has a

slight software engineering connotation. In addition,

medical itself is pretty heavy on software

engineering. So I'm going to give it a score of .344 software

engineering. Then for the second

piece of text here. Well, it's definitely talking about software

engineering, so I'm going to give it a score of .97 for that. And

then it also mentions infection vectors, which has

that connotation of medicine. So I'll

give it a slightly higher medicine score as well of

.3. Now that we have generated

these embeddings, We're going to go through

an extra little step of mathematics here,

something referred to as normalization. Now, you

do not really have to understand normalization that much.

This is already going to be done for you in the vast majority of cases

by the embedding API that you are using. This normalization

step is going to scale the magnitude of each of these

pairs of vectors to 1.0. And if you don't understand

that terminology, totally fine. Don't sweat it too much.

Just understand that we're going to do a slight little adjustment

to the actual magnitude of each number. Once we have

generated these embeddings and normalized them, we can

kind of visualize them on a plot like this. So

on this plot, I've drawn a unit circle, and each

of our points representing both those embeddings will

lie exactly on the circle because we have normalized their lengths

to exactly one. So we've got the software

engineering section up here, and here's medical research

over here. So now that we have these embeddings,

we're going to move on to the next step. In this step, we are

going to take these embeddings and store them inside of something

called a vector database. This is a database

that has been optimized for storing, comparing, and

looking up long lists of numbers exactly like

what our embeddings are. Now, at this point in time,

we pause, we take a break, because this

is all been pre-processing work that we did ahead of

time. So at this point, we just sit around

and wait for a user to actually submit a query to

our application. So we will imagine that at some

point in time, finally, a user will come to our app and

maybe type into a chatbot or something like that in

their question or their query. Maybe in this case,

their question is going to be something like, I'm curious about the company,

in particular, what did the software engineering department

do this year? Now at this point in time, we're going to take

that user's question and we're going to run it through the exact

same imaginary embedding model. In

this scenario, because the user's question is asking

specifically about software engineering, I'll give it a score

of 0.89. And then because it's also talking

about company and again software engineering is kind

of tied up in the medical field, I'll give it a very slight

medical score as well of 0.1. Now

that we have this embedding, we're going to go and go through

that normalization step again. And

then finally, we're going to make use of our vector

database. We're going to take the user's query. We're going

to feed it into the vector database and say,

please search through all the vectors we have stored inside

of you and give us the vector that is closest

in nature to this one. So in our

case, I would kind of expect to get back Section 2

software engineering because that's kind of what the user asked

about over here. But let me tell you exactly what

is happening inside of the vector database that is

able to give us this very closely related result.

Okay, so a little bit of math here, don't worry, won't be

too much. So when we take the user's query

and add it onto this chart, we can see right away that

visually the user's query is just really

close to software engineering. So you and I as humans,

we could look at this chart and say, oh yeah, clearly these two things

are very close. The user's query is very similar

to software engineering. So obviously, if we want

to find some chunks inside the vector database related

to the user query, this would be the one that we want.

But of course, we are using computers here. And our computer doesn't

actually just make a chart like this and then look at it. There's some

actual calculation going on behind the scenes. So

let's examine exactly what that calculation is. And

it's kind of important for you to know it because eventually

when you start using vector databases, they're going to use a lot

of terminology that's related to this kind

of math going on behind the scenes. And to actually

interface well with the vector database, you kind of

need to have at least a very basic understanding of the math.

So that's why I want you to understand it. All right, here's

a high-level look at the map that is being done inside

of your vector database. To find which embeddings

are most similar to the user's query, we want to calculate something

called the cosine similarity. This is the

cosine of the angle between the user's query

and each of the other embeddings stored in the database. So

we'd want to find the angle A, right here,

and take the cosine of it, and angle B right

here, and take the cosine of it. The math

for this is shown on the right-hand side. The result

of this calculation will be a number between negative 1

and 1. If we get a result close to 1,

as we did right here, then that means that we have found

an embedding very similar to the user's query. Results

closer to negative 1 mean we have found an

embedding that are not at all similar to the user's query.

In our case, the cosine similarity between our user query

and the software engineering chunk is 0.983,

meaning that these two embeddings are very similar. So

this is a sign to us that we would want to take the

software engineering chunk of text and include it in our

prompt with the user's question. Now, before we move on, one

other quick thing that's going to be a little confusing right now,

but it's going to be very, very helpful to know later on when

you start working with vector databases. In

a lot of vector database documentation, you're going to see something

referred to as a cosine distance. This

is different than the cosine similarity. It

is calculated as one minus the cosine

similarity. As adjustment is often done,

just to give us an easier to interpret number. With

a cosine distance, values close to zero mean

you have a large similarity. And larger

values than that mean we have less similarity.

Again, this is something you're going to see very often

in vector database documentation. So just

be aware of it whenever you see the term cosine distance and

cosine similarity. So now that we understand some of this math

at a very high level, let's get back on track.

Once we have found a text chunk with a high similarity

to the user's question, we're going to take the user's question, add

it into our prompt, and the text chunk that we found

that's most relevant and put that into our prompt as well. We

then take that prompt and send it off to Claude.

And that's the entire process in great, great detail.

So now that we understand everything from start to finish

with all the kind of tech behind the scenes going on and even

some of the math, let's start to implement this inside

of a notebook in just a moment.
