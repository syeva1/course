# MCP clients

## Transcript

The next portion of model context protocol that we're going to investigate

is the client. The purpose of the client is

to provide a means of communication between your server

and a MCP server. This client is going to

be your access point to all the tools implemented by that server.

Now MCP is transport agnostic. This

is a fancy term that just says that the client and the

server can communicate over a variety of different

protocols. A very common way to run a MCP

server right now is on the same physical machine as

the MCP client. And if these two things are running

on the same machine, then they can communicate over standard

input output. And that's what we are going to be setting up

later on inside this section. There are,

however, other ways we can connect the MCP client

with the MCP server. So they can also connect

over HTTP or Web Sockets or

any of a number of other varieties or techniques.

Once a connection has been formed between the client and the

server, they communicate by exchanging messages.

The exact messages that are allowed are all defined inside

of the MCP spec. Some of the message types

that you and I are going to be focusing are the list

tools request and the list tools result.

As you guessed, list tools request is sent from the client

to the server and asks the server to list out all the different tools

that it provides. The server would then respond with

a list tools result message, which contains

a list of all the different tools that it can provide.

Two other common message types that you and I are going to see are

the call tool request and call tool result.

The first will ask the server to run a tool with some

particular arguments, and the second will contain the result

of the tool run. Now, at this point

in time, we've got this idea of a server and

a client. But I suspect it's probably

not really clear how all this stuff really works together. So

here's what we're going to do in the remainder of this video. We

are going to walk through a example call between

a lot of different things. So it's going to be kind of an involved

process. But we're going to imagine the communication that goes on between

a user or a server that we're putting together.

A MCP client, the MCP server, GitHub

as some provider that we're trying to access some data from, and

Claude. So let's get to it. Again, Stephen Grider, first

thing we would expect to happen is a user to submit some kind of query

or question to our server, like what repositories do

I have? At this point, it would be up to our server

to make a request off to Claude. But in that

request, we want to list out all the different tools that Claude has

access to. So before our server can make the request

off to Claude, it's first going to go through a little side detour

through the MCP client and the server. So here's what

happens. The server is going to realize that it

needs to see a list of tools to send off

to Claude, along with the user's query. So it's going to

ask the MCP client to get a list of tools. The

MCP client, in turn, is going to send a list

tools request off to the server, and the server

will respond with a list tools result.

Now that our MCP client has a list of the tools,

it will give that list of tools back to the server. And

now our server has everything it needs to make an initial

request off to Claude. It has both the original

message from the user and a list of tools to include.

So our server can make a request off to Claude with that query

and the set of tools. Claude is going to take a look

at the tools and realize, you know what, in order to answer

the user's original question right here, I really want

to call a tool. So Claude would respond

with some tool use message part. At

this point, our server is going to realize that Claude wants

to run a tool. But our server is no longer

really in charge of executing any tools. Instead,

our tools are going to be executed by the MCP server.

So in order to run the tool that Claude is asking

for, our server is going to ask the MCP client

to run a tool with some particular arguments that were

provided by Claude. The MCP client, however,

doesn't actually run the tool. It's going to send a call

tool request off to the MCP server. The

MCP server will receive that request and make

a follow request off to GitHub. So

this is where we would actually be getting a list of repositories

that belong to this particular user. GitHub

would respond with that list of repositories. Then

the MCP server would wrap up that data

inside of a call tool result and send

that back to the MCP client. Then the MCP

client in turn would hand the result off to our server.

Now our server has the list of repositories

and it can make a follow up request to Claude with

the tool result part inside of a user

message. So this tool result would include the list

of repositories that Claude was asking for.

And now Claude has all the information it needs to formulate

a final response. So it'll write out some text

of something like your repositories are, and then send that back

to our server, and our server would send it on back to our

user. All right, so this flow,

yes, it is rather complicated. The reason I want

to show you this is that we are going to see all these different

pieces as you and I start to implement our own

custom MCP client and MCP

server a little bit later on.
