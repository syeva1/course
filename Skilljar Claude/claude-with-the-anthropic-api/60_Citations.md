## Transcript

In the PDF file that we were just working with, I'm going to scroll down

to the very bottom page. And done here at the bottom,

you'll notice that it mentions that Earth's atmosphere in oceans

were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.

Now, as a little exercise, I want to try to ask Claude

a very simple question. I want to ask it how Earth's atmospheres

and oceans were formed. And I would probably expect

to see some kind of answer that says something like volcanic activity

and outgassing. So I'm going to copy this right here and

put it into my prompt, and ask Claude. Power,

Earth's atmosphere and oceans formed. Now,

I'm going to run this really quick. And for me at

least, I'll notice that in the very first sentence here, I'm given

a very appropriate answer. I'm told that these were

formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. So that's

really exactly what I would expect. But I want you to imagine

getting this answer from the perspective of a user. When

a user sees this generated text, they might think that it's just

Claude speaking directly from memory here. And the

user might not really understand that we are actually citing some

kind of source here. In this case, the source is not perfect. It

is Wikipedia, but at least it is something.

So what would be really fantastic is if there was some kind

of way to somehow inform the user or tell them how

we are getting this information. Luckily, Claude has

access to a feature called Citations. Citations

allow Claude to refer to some outside source

of information directly and say that it got its answer

by looking at some other document or some other source of

text. Now, let me show you how citations work

because once you see it in action, I think you'll have a really

good idea of what's going on. I'm going to scroll up to

our prompt right here, and I'm going to make a little modification

to the first block that we're putting into

this message. Right after the source field, I'm going

to add in a title of earth.pdf

because that is the name of the PDF file that we are opening and

a citations field that will be a dictionary with

enabled true, like so.

Now I'm going to send off this request again. And

let's see what we get back now. Now we're going to see that our response

is much more complicated than it was previously. Our

content field right here is a list that has some text

blocks and some of these text block things have a

citations list with something called a citation page

location. So let's focus on exactly what

a citation page location is for just a moment. Let's

show you a diagram. A citation page location

is Claude's way of telling us exactly where it got some

fact or some piece of information from. So

in our case, we got back a structure that has

a cited text, document index, document title,

start page, and end page. The cited text is

the text out of the source document, in our case, earth.pdf,

that is somehow supporting Claude's statement. The

document index and the document title tell us exactly where

this statement was made, and the start and end page

tell us exactly where inside of that document that

statement was made. Now, the real intent behind

giving you these citations is to allow you to build up a user

interface that looks something like this out of Claude's answer.

So I took the response that we just got out of Claude. I

fed it back into Claude and asked it to render

that entire response in a nicely formatted document and

give me some popups to represent all the different citations.

But now if I mouse over the one or the two or the

three, I'll see a nicely formatted popup appear.

This popup contains all the information out of that citation

page location object. It is meant to inform the user

that Claude's response here, specifically this sentence,

really, is being informed by some outside document.

So in this case, this sentence is coming from earth.pdf,

specifically some text on pages four to five,

and the actual text that we're citing is earth's atmosphere was,

et cetera, et cetera. So this entire citations feature

allows you to build up interfaces like this where a user

can be assured that the information being presented by Claude

is coming from some actual outside source. The

user can then go and refer to that source and make sure that Claude

is correctly interpreting the information inside

that outside document. This citations feature is

not restricted to only being used with PDF documents.

You can also use it with plain text as well. So

as a very quick example, in the cell right above, I

manually copy pasted in some text out of the PDF

document, and I assigned it to a variable of article text.

Now I can go back down to where I'm making my request down here, and

I'm going to make a big update to this block. I'm

going to leave the type of document. I'm going to leave this

source, but I'm going to change the type to be text.

I'm going to change the media type to be text slash plain,

and then the data. to

be article. So that is the text.

That was, oh, sorry, it's article text. There we go. So that's

the text that I assigned to that variable up there. I'm

then going to change the title to how about something

like earth article, since it's not really directly

a PDF file anymore. And then I can leave the enabled

true with citations in there. So now if I run

this again, and take a look at the response,

we will see that instead of a citation page location,

now we get a citation chart location. So

this is going to give us a position inside of that big block

of text that Claude is citing from. We can

now use this to build up a very similar interface to the one I just showed

you inside the browser. So again, you can cite from plain

text or PDF documents. Either way,

I really recommend you make use of the citations feature anytime

that it's critical to make sure that users can somehow

investigate how Claude is building up its response and

ensure that Claude is drawing information from some

source documents, either a PDF or plain text.
