# Automated debugging

## Transcript

Cloud Code is not just about helping you author

some code inside of your editor. It can also help you after

you have deployed your application in monitoring

for errors in helping you fix those errors as they arise.

So in this video, I'm going to walk you through a sample workflow where

we are going to take a look at a production application that is throwing

some errors, but only in a production environment. We're

going to see how we can make use of Cloud Code to automatically find

and fix those errors. So first,

let me show you a little sample application I put together. This

is a very simple chatbot, and I'm currently running

it locally on my own computer. You can see the evidence

for that. I'm currently at localhost 3000. If

I ask any question here, let's say maybe what's one

plus one, no problem. I'll get back and answer

rather quickly. This chat application also has the

ability to make simple artifacts. So for example,

it can show a built-in spreadsheet. I'm going to ask

for a spreadsheet with some fake data. And

it appears that everything is working 100% as expected.

Now remember, this application is currently running in my local

development environment. But because everything is working just

fine as I'm testing it right now, I might decide to

go ahead and deploy it into production. So I've

already done that ahead of time. I've already taken this exact app

and deployed it off to AWS Amplify. So

this is a production version of the exact same

app it has hosted at Amplify right now. I'm

going to attribute the exact same test that I showed you a moment ago. I'm

going to first ask what is one plus one. Then

I will follow up with the exact same request that

I made a moment ago in the local application. So make

a spreadsheet with some fake data. And we're going to

see that the request goes through. But

unfortunately, the spreadsheet itself is completely empty.

There's actually no data that has been generated. So

it is now clear that something in this production environment

is not really working as expected. Everything

in development worked just fine. The exact same series

of operations completely fine in development, but specifically

in a production environment, I am running into this error. To

figure out what the issue is, I could take a look at my CloudWatch

logs. I already opened those up, and I've already hunted

through those logs and found the source of this error.

So I've got an air message here. It states the provided model

identifier is invalid. And then I've got a lot of debug

information included in here as well. So I

as an engineer could take this air message, which I

had to hunt down inside of my logs and do

a little bit of local debugging to try to figure out why

this is failing in production, but not locally.

Alternatively, I could delegate this entire

task off to Claude. Let me show you how. Inside

of my GitHub repository for this project, I created a GitHub

Action, which is going to run automatically every day, very

early in the morning. On the screen right now, I have the

results of a sample run from earlier today. I'll

show you some of these logs from the GitHub Action in just a moment.

But first, let me show you a diagram that's going to help you understand what

is going on inside this. OK, so

whenever this GitHub Action runs, it's going to check out my repository,

install some dependencies, and then install and set up

Cloud Code. I then also install an AWS

CLI, which allows me to reach out and get some

logs from CloudWatch. I then pass off

some directions to Claude. I ask it to

reach out to CloudWatch and find all the errors that have occurred in

the last 24 hours. I also include some logic

in there to remove duplicate errors and reduce the total

number of errors down just to be manageable for Claude's

context window. Once Claude has a list of errors,

it then iterates over them and attempts to fix each one.

And then once Claude hopefully has successfully fixed

these errors, it will commit those changes and automatically

open a pull request where I can view its work. So

in this case, as we just saw, I'm getting an error in

our production environment. And I saw that error inside

the logs. If I now go over to my

list of pull requests right here, I'll say that Claude automatically

ran, it automatically found the issue, applied

a fix, and then created a pull request. So now

I could very easily review this pull request right here.

The entire issue is explained to me in plain detail, and

in this case, it was just a typo on my behalf. I

accidentally put in a invalid model ID that was

only used in a production environment. So Claude,

noticed that. It found the correct model ID and

put the correct one in, committed the changes. So

now I can very easily review the changes and merge the pull

request. This is just one sample workflow

that you might use to automatically monitor and fix your apps

in a production environment. Remember, Cloud Code is

very flexible and you can create your own custom workflows

just like this one to aid your own debugging efforts.
