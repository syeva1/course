# The batch tool

## Transcript

I've now repeated several times that a single assistant message

can have multiple tool use blocks inside of it. So for

example, if we ask Claude to evaluate 10 plus 10 and

30 plus 30, Claude might send us back an assistant

message that has two separate tool use blocks inside of it.

Claude has realized that these two operations can be ran in

parallel. So we can do both tool calls

at the same time and then send a single follow-up back to Claude

that has the results of both evaluations.

However, we'll notice that in practice, getting Claude

to do this can sometimes be a little bit challenging. Let

me show you why. So back inside my notebook,

I've updated my prompt. I'm now asking Claude

to do two tasks in parallel. I'm asking it to

set two separate reminders on the same date. The

first reminder is going to have that text right there, and there's a

second reminder right there. Now there's no reason whatsoever

that Claude cannot send us back a single response

with two tool use blocks inside of it. But

if I run the cell, we'll see very quickly that that is

not what actually happens. If

I take a look at the messages that get output, we'll

notice that I get back an initial assistant message

that actually only has one single tool use block

inside of it. I then go through another round

of requests right here, and the second assistant message

that I get back has another tool use block. So let

me show you what's going on here in diagram format. OK,

so here's what's happening. We are sending the initial user

message off to Claude asking to set the two separate reminders.

And then in the first response we get back, there's only one

tool use block. We then respond to that with the tool

results, and then we get another tool use block separately.

This additional round of requests right here is completely unnecessary.

Ideally, this is what would have happened. We would have

sent the initial user message off and then we would have gotten back an

assistant message that has two separate tool use blocks inside

of it. One to set the taxes due appointment and

one for doctors appointment. Although Claude has

the ability to send a response back with multiple tool use blocks

inside of it, it doesn't do so quite as often as we might want.

However, there's a little trick we can use to greatly

increase the chance of Claude sending back multiple tool

uses inside of a single message. The trick is

to implement a batch tool. So let me tell you exactly

what a batch tool is. The batch tool is deceptively

simple. This is another tool, just like get

current date time or add duration to date time. The

tools we already put together. So you and I are going

to define the schema and a function for this

tool. We are then going to pass it into Claude, just

like we are passing in all the other tools we have already created.

The batch tool schema tells Claude that it can run multiple other

tools in parallel. If Claude decides that it does

want to run multiple other tools, rather than calling

those tools directly, it's going to instead call the

batch tool. And it's going to provide some arguments that

look like what you see right here. it will be a list

of objects, or each object, is meant to represent

some other tool that Claude wants to call. So

we might have a object right here to represent setting

a reminder for the doctor's appointment, and then another one

right here to represent setting a reminder for taxes being

due. Whenever we get a response back that has

a tool use of the batch tool, you and I are

going to write out some code to take this array of objects right

here. We're going to iterate over it, and we're going to invoke each

of the listed tools here. So you can think of this as

being like an abstraction on top of these tool

use blocks. The issue here again is that Claude

doesn't really want to respond with multiple tool use blocks, so

we're kind of giving it this higher level abstraction that does

the exact same thing as having multiple

tool use blocks. The only difference is that you and I are

handling manually through the implementation of this batch

tool. It might sound crazy that this works, and

I think it kind of is a little bit crazy, but

like I said, it very much is a trick. We are kind

of tricking Claude into calling multiple tools in parallel.

So let's go back over to our notebook, and we're going to try to implement

this batch tool. OK, so back over

here, to help us out inside of the Tools

and Schema section, at the very bottom of it, I have

already provided us a schema for the batch tool.

Whenever Claude decides to call the batch tool, it's going to provide

us a list of invocations. So this list

is a description of all the other tools that Claude wants to

call. inside of this invocations list, there's

going to be a name of some other tool that Claude wants

to invoke and then some arguments to provide to that

tool. I would like to give you a quick demonstration of how

this thing works. So I'm going to collapse that cell. I'm

going to go to our run conversation function

right here, and I'm going to add in that batch

tool schema. I'm

then going to make sure that I run that cell. I'm then going

to go down to the demonstration cell that I have down here, where

I'm asking Claude to do two things, hopefully in parallel.

And now I'm going to run this again. Before I look at the results,

there's something very important that I want to point out here. We

have now added in the batch tool schema, but we haven't actually

provided an implementation for it. So in other words, there's

no code to actually take that list of invocations

that Claude wants to do and actually run them. So that's

something we still have to implement. Let's take a look

at the list of messages and see what Claude decided to do.

All right, so we've got our initial user message, and then a

follow-up assistant message. Inside of that, there is

a text block, and then a single tool use block.

And if you look carefully, Claude did in fact decide

to use the batch tool. So Claude wants to run

two separate tools. We can see them listed out inside the

list of invocations. So we are going to make two

separate calls, one to set reminder with

the content of I have a doctor's appointment, and then a second

with content of taxes are due. So

it is clear that Claude has decided to use the batch

tool in order to parallelize the two separate

set reminder calls. So now all we have to do is provide

an actual implementation for the batch tool. Let me show you how

we do that. First, I'm going to scroll up to

our run tool function. Here it is right here. I'm

going to add in an additional else if case.

So if Claude wants to run the batch

tool, I will return a call to a new function

that we are going to implement named run batch.

And I'll once again do a star star tool input.

I'm then going to implement the run batch function just right above

this one. So we'll add in a run batch.

It's going to take in a list of invocations. And

I'll default that to be a empty list. Inside of

here, we are going to write out some logic very similar to what we did

down inside of run tools. So we are going to iterate over

all the different invocations that Claude is asking for. We're

going to run the appropriate tool. Well, then formulate some

kind of response, add all these different responses

into a list, and then return a list at the very end. So

here's how we do that. First, I'm going to make a list

that is going to hold the output from all these different tool calls we

make. I'm going to name it batch output. I'm

going to make sure that I return that at the bottom of the function. In

between, I'm going to iterate over all the different invocations that

Claude requested. So for invocation in invocations,

I'm going to extract out the name of the tool that Claude wants to run along

with the arguments to it. Now

the arguments that are being passed in here are encoded as JSON.

So we need to parse that JSON using the JSON module, which

we already imported right there. So I can wrap that with a

JSON load string. Then

we're going to run the requested tool by making

use of the run tool function right here. So run tool,

it already takes in a tool name and some arguments and calls

the appropriate tool. So we can leverage that to make sure that we call the

appropriate tool. I'll get some

tool output by calling run tool

with the name and arcs. Then

I'm going to add in a new record to our batch output list

that's going to describe this invocation and the results that

came out of it. So I'll add in a batch

output, I'll pen to it, a

tool name of name and

a output. of

tool output. Let's now test this out.

I'm going to make sure I run the cell. I'll then go down

to my test cell at the very bottom. I'm going

to run this again. And now that we have provided an actual

implementation for invocations, we should

see very quickly two separate reminders being set

absolutely in parallel. Very good. Definitely

worked. If we take a look at the listed messages, we are

once again getting our assistant block right here. It has

a tool use block that is trying to call the batch

tool with the two separate invocations right

there. And then we are responding with a two result.

And inside of that, we can see the results of our two separate

calls to set reminder. The output is null, which is

expected because right now the set reminder tool doesn't actually

return anything.
