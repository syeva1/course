# Being specific

## Transcript

The next topic we're going to discuss in the world of prompt engineering is

the idea of being specific. To be specific,

we want our prompts to list out some sort of guidelines

or steps to somehow direct our model in a particular

direction. For example, consider the prompt to

have on the left-hand side of the screen. In this prompt, I'm

asking Claude to write out a short story about a character

who discovers a hidden talent. If I just put that

prompt by itself into Claude, Claude can go

any of an infinite number of directions.

It can decide to vary the story length significantly.

It can decide to add in extra elements or remove elements

from the story. It might have just one character, it might introduce

five different characters. If I want to ensure that

I'm going to get a particular kind of output, I might

decide to put in a list of guidelines, as you see on

the right-hand side. These guidelines will provide some

high-level guidance or kind of direct Claude in

a specific way when it starts generating the response. So

for example, I might decide to add in some guidelines of

keeping the story under a thousand words, add in some

rising actions, and including at least one supporting

character. Now I've provided a little bit of guidance

to direct Claude towards writing a particular kind

of short story. Now there are

two kinds of guidelines you're going to see very often in prompts.

Type A on the left hand side is kind of like what I just showed you

in the previous diagram. You might decide to put in a

list of guidelines and those are going to list out some qualities

that you want your output to have. So you might try

to control maybe the length of the output or the structure

of the output or maybe list out some different attributes

that the output should have. On the right

hand side, the second type of guidelines that we can provide are

to provide some actual steps that the model should follow, with

the intent of making the model think about specific

things or choose between different directions that

would hopefully increase the quality of our output. So

for example, we might instruct Claude to maybe first

brainstorm three special talents that would be really

interesting and then pick the most interesting one.

We might then ask Claude to try to outline or think

about some kind of interesting scene that would reveal that talent,

and then think about different kinds of supporting characters that

could make the story a little bit more interesting. So

on the left hand side, we're really guiding attributes in

the output. On the right hand side, we're trying to be

a little bit more specific in how Claude arrives at

the final product. You can absolutely,

and you're gonna see this very often in professional prompts, you'll

absolutely, very often see these two techniques mixed together.

So you might have a list of guidelines that intend to control

some attributes of the output, and then a list of steps

that the model should follow as well. Both of these

are examples of being specific in your prompting.

So now we've seen some idea around what it means to be

specific. Let's go back over to our prompt in progress

and see if we can incorporate this idea of being specific.

All right, so back over here, I'm taking a look at my run prompt

function. Now, just to save a little bit of time, I'm going

to first paste in a list of guidelines. So

this is kind of like that first type of being specific,

where I include a list of attributes that I really want

to see inside of the output. I'm

going to run that cell and

then go down and run the eval again. And

let's see what we get here. So after a quick

pause, I'm going to get back a final score of 7.86.

That is an incredible improvement

over our previous 3.92, just

by adding in a little bit of guidance and telling

Claude precisely what things we want to see inside

of the output. Now I'm going to try to put in a little

variant of this where I use that second variation

of being specific. So I'm going to provide some

steps that Claude should follow when deciding exactly

how to build up this meal plan. So now in this scenario,

I'm telling Claude to first do a calculation and

then think about this and then do a little bit of planning. You

kind of get the idea. I'm providing some steps that Claude should

go through. I'm going to run this cell again. And

then run down here, and I'm going to remember that score of 7.86, that

is really, really high, might be a little bit of a

statistical anomaly. And

now we get 7.3. So still a dramatic improvement,

but not quite as good as listing out some

attributes that we would want to see inside the output. So for me, I'm

going to revert and go back to listing

out some guidelines. So when would you want to use

one technique versus the other? Well, I would generally

recommend almost always listing out qualities

that the output should have as I'm showing on the left hand side on

just about any prompt you ever work on. And you will usually

want to provide steps that the model should follow, as shown

on the right-hand side, any time you're asking Claude to work

on a more complex problem, where you want to kind of force

Claude to consider a wider view or some extra

topics beyond what it naturally might want to consider.

For example, consider the prompt on the right-hand side of the screen, where

I ask Claude to figure out why a sales team's numbers

have dropped in the last quarter. In this scenario, we

might want to force Claude to consider some extra

viewpoints or extra pieces of data that it might not otherwise

immediately consider. All right, so now that we've got a better

idea of what it really means to be specific and this

idea of adding guidelines or steps as the situation

warrants, let's take another break right here and then move

on to our next prompt engineering topic in just a moment.
