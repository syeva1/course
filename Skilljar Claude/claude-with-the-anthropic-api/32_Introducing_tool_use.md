# Introducing tool use

## Transcript

In this module, we are going to discuss tool use.

Tools allow Claude to access information from the outside

world. Now, understanding tool use can be a little bit

challenging, so in this video, I'm going to give you a really

soft introduction. We are going to walk through the entire

flow of tool use and understand what it's all about. I

want to first begin by giving you an example of where Claude

can, unfortunately, sometimes hit its

limits. Remember, by default, Claude

only has access to information that was actually trained on.

So in general, it doesn't really have any information about very

recent current events. As an example

of this, if we had a user making use of our chatbot, ask

a question of something like, what's the weather in San Francisco,

California right now? And so if that off to Claude, we

would probably get a response back of something like, I'm

sorry, but I don't have access to up to date weather

information like that. To fix this and give the user

a better response, we can make use of tools.

Let me show you a diagram that's going to break down tools with really

simple terminology. And I'll show you another one that's

going to give you an example of how we would solve this specific

weather problem. OK, so here's the entire

flow that we're going to eventually implement when we start to make

use of tools. We're going to send off an initial

request to Claude. We're going to ask a question or maybe

give Claude a task. And along with that, we're going to

include instructions on how Claude can get some extra

data from the outside world. Claude

will then take a look at whatever question it was asked or whatever

task it was given, and it might decide that it needs to

ask for some extra data. So it'll send a response

back to us where it asks for some extra data, and it's going

to give us some details on exactly what information it

needs. Then on our server, we

are going to run a little bit of code that will go in, get

the information that Claude asked for, and then respond

with that on a follow-up request back to Claude.

Now Claude has all the information it needs in theory

to give us a response. So it will generate a final

response that will be hopefully augmented or

improved by that extra data. Now

I'm going to show you the same exact flow, but I'm going to customize

each of these little steps for this scenario where a user

asks us for some current weather in a particular location.

So here's what happened. We would send an initial query

off to Claude, and it would include a prompt where the user asks

about the weather. And inside of that initial request,

we're going to include details on specifically how

to retrieve current weather data. Claude

would take a look at the prompt and decide, hey, to answer this

question, I need to get some current weather data. It

send response back to us, where we would then run some

code that would reach out to some maybe third party

weather API and actually get some live

details on what the current weather is for a particular

location. Once we have those details

from that outside API, we would then make a follow-up

request to Claude with that current weather data. And

now, Claude has all the information it needs. It has

the original prompt along with the up-to-date

weather data so it can generate a final response and

send it back to us.
