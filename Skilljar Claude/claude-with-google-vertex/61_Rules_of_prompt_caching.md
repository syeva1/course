# Rules of prompt caching

## Transcript

Now that we understand the theory, we are going to explore how prompt

caching Claude actually works. The core idea of

prompt caching is identical to what we discussed in the last

video. We will make an initial request off

to Claude. Claude is going to do some processing

on that initial message, and then Claude is going to

save all that work into a temporary cache.

Then if we make a fault request at some future point

in time and include the identical exact

same message, rather than processing that message

all over again, Claude is going to instead look into the cache,

find the work that it had already saved, and load

it up. Just to be clear, the work that be saved the

cache does not persist forever. It is only stored

there for five minutes. You're going to find prompt

caching is most useful anytime that you are

repeatedly sending the same content over to Claude again

and again and again, because it really is this kind

of two phase process. We have to make that initial request

to write some data into the cache, and then only the follow

up requests are going to be able to take advantage of that work

that was done ahead of time. This caching system is not

enabled by default with Claude. Instead, to turn

on caching, we have to manually add a cache breakpoint

to a block inside of one of our different messages. And

I've showed an example of that on the right-hand side in this example

user message. So all we have to do to turn on

caching is put in that little cache control field. And

there's a lot of rules around what that cache control thing actually

does. But before we go into those rules and really explain

what's going on, I want to give you a little tip

here, something that's going to make your life a little bit easier.

Throughout this course, we've been making use of a little shorthand

for writing out text blocks very frequently. And I'm

showing that on the left hand side. So this is a user message

that is using the shorthand for defining a text block.

If we have a user message that only has a little bit of

text signed to it, we can assign a string directly

to that content field. There is another way

in which we can write out a text block, and I'm showing this alternative

way of writing out a text block on the right-hand side. So

the alternative method is to write out a content field,

assign a list to it, and then side there put a dictionary

that has a type of text and then a text field that

contains your actual text. Now, we have not really been making

use of that long-hand form. But if you want to use

cache control, we want to turn on this prompt caching feature,

you have to write out these text fields in long form.

So you can actually add on that cache control

field. In other words, we have to write out cache

control somewhere. And over here on the right-hand side, we have some place

to put it. If we use the short form, there's no place for

us to put it. When we add a breakpoint into a block,

All the content in our entire request is going to be cached

up to and including that breakpoint. So

in this scenario, if we send in a request like this where the first

block has a breakpoint, Claude is going to do some amount

of work processing this text right here. And

it's going to result in some amount of work done. Because

this text block has a breakpoint, this work is

going to be stored inside the cache. But this

later work is after the breakpoint, so it's not

going to be cache. If we then send a follow-up request later

on, Claude is going to take a look into the cache and find

that some work was already done for processing this

very first block. So it's going to retrieve that work and

use it to save itself a little bit of effort. One thing to keep

in mind is that our follow-up request must have identical

content inside of it all the way up to that breakpoint.

So for example, if our initial text block right here

that had a breakpoint, if we added in just the word, please

do it. No longer is this content identical. And

so this work would not have been used as out of the cache.

Instead, Claude would reprocess this entire block

and all the content before it. Cache breakpoints can

span across multiple different messages and multiple different

blocks. So for example, if we send in a user

message and then an assistant and then another user,

and the very last message here has a block with a breakpoint,

Everything is going to be cached up to and including

this block right here. So we'd imagine that the

work that is done to process all three of those messages is

going to be stored inside the cache. Then when we make

our follow request later on, as long as everything up

to and including that break point is identical, the

work is going to be retrieved out of the cache. And again, we're

going to save ourselves a little bit of effort. We are not restricted

to adding cache points onto text blocks. We can

also add them onto almost any other type of block, like

an image block or a tool use or a tool result.

We can also add these onto tool schemas and

onto system prompts as well. And I've shown an example

of both those on the right-hand side. You are very often going

to enable caching for your tools and for your system

prompt as well. Because it turns out that for most applications,

not all, but for many applications, your system prompt

and your list of tools don't end up changing. So these

are excellent places to place a cache breakpoint.

In total, we can apply a breakpoint to tool schemas, system

prompts, and message blocks. Now, these are

not three separate cache systems. And

let me show you exactly what I mean by that. Whenever

you add in tools, a system prompt, and messages, behind

the scenes, these all get joined together when they are

fed into Claude, and they get joined together in that particular

order. It is first the tools, then a system prompt,

and then your list of messages. So if you place a

cache breakpoint on your very last tool, everything

up to and including that last tool will

be cached. But the system prompt and your list

of messages will not be cached. So if we then

make a follow request and we change that assistant message

right there, toy fine. We're still

going to save ourselves a little bit of work because the list

of tools was cash ahead of time. Last thing I

want to mention very quickly is that we can add in multiple different

cash breakpoints, up to four in total. So

I might decide to add in a cash breakpoint at the last

tool schema that I pass in, and then maybe I add

in a cash breakpoint on this assistant message down here.

If I then make a follow request and I change the user

message down here, no problem. We're going to save

ourselves the work of having to reprocess the entire

list of tools and assistant prompt and user message as well.

Likewise, if we change the first user message, well,

then we're going to invalidate the cache for everything down here, but

we'll still have the cache work for our list of tools.

So we are very often going to add in multiple different cache

breakpoints if appropriate. We might decide to

cache our entire list of tools and the system prompt

and maybe some number of messages as well. Exactly

where you place these different breakpoints really just comes down to

your particular application. The very last thing I want to share

with you is that there is a minimum content length for caching.

So in order to cache some amount of content, we must cache

at least 1,024 tokens. So

on the top right-hand example, I've got a cache breakpoint

on a message that has only the text high there. This

is definitely not 1,024 tokens long,

so this content would not be written to the cache.

But if I took that text block and duplicated

500 times, now I've

probably got greater than 1,024 tokens, so

this entire list of different blocks would be cash.
