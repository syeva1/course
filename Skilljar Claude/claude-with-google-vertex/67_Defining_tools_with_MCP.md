# Defining tools with MCP

## Transcript

Let's start to make an MCP server for our

CLI chatbot. As you saw, the

CLI itself already works, and we can already chat with

Claude, but there's no additional functionality around the MCP

server tied to it just yet. So we're going to work on adding

in this MCP server that is going to have two tools

in it for right now. It's going to have one tool to read a document

and one tool to update the contents of a document.

The implementation of the server is going to be placed into the MCP

server.py file inside of the root project

directory. Inside of here, I've already gone through a little

bit of work to set up a basic MCP server. And

then I defined a collection of documents that are going to exist

only in memory. And then finally, I put together some

different to-do items. So these are different tasks that you

and I are going to complete inside of this file. For

right now, as I just mentioned, we're going to be working only on these first

two items, writing out two tools. Now

we have authored tools in the past, and we saw that,

oh, there's a lot of syntax there. There's those big JSON

schemas. But I got good news for you here. In

this project, we're making use of the official MCP

Python SDK. So that's what this MCP

packages we're making use inside of here. This

MCP package is going to create our MCP server

for us with just one line of code, like what you see right

there. This SDK also makes

it really easy to define tools. To define

a tool, all we have to do is write out what you see on the right-hand

side over here. This will make a tool named add

integers with this description and

two arguments that are going to be required to be passed into

it. Once we write out a tool definition like

this, behind the scenes, MCP is going to generate

a tool JSON schema for us, which

we can take and pass off to Claude. So

right away, as you can see, it starts to get a lot easier to do

some basic things like defined tools. Now, as I

mentioned, our first task is going to be to implement these two

different tools. So let's go back over to our MCP

server.py file right away, and we're going to start to implement

the first tool of reading a document. So

the only goal here is to take in the name of some document

and return the contents of it. All of our

documents are already placed inside of this docs dictionary.

The keys are the IDs or essentially names

of a document, and the value is a document's contents. So

our tool is really simple. We're going to take in one

of these strings, look up the appropriate value

inside this docs dictionary, and then return it. That's all

we need to do. So to implement this,

I'm going to find the first to do and right underneath it, I'm

going to define a new tool by writing out at

mcp.tool. I'm going

to give this tool a name of read_contents

and a description of read the contents of

a document and return it as a string. And

remember, in a perfect world, we put in a really fleshed

out description right here to make sure it's super clear to Claude,

exactly when to use this tool. But right now, just

as usual, to save a little bit of time and keep you from

having to type out a bunch of text here, I'm just going to leave in a very

simple description. then I will define my

actual tool function. So this is the function to run

whenever we decide to run this tool. I

will call it read_document. It's

going to take in a argument of doc_id that

is going to be a string. I'm

going to set that to a field with a description

of ID of the document to

read. And then we need to make sure that we import

this field class at the top. So I'm going to

go up to the top and add an import

from pydantic import field.

then back down here inside of the function

body, I'm going to put in my actual implementation. So

the first thing I'm going to do is just make sure I handle the case in

which Claude asks for a document that doesn't actually exist.

So I'll say if doc_id not

in docs. So in other words, if the provided

document ID is not found as a key inside of this dictionary,

then I'm going to raise a value error with

a f-string of doc with id {doc_id} not

found. And

then if we get past that check, I'll go ahead and return the actual

document. So I'll return docs[doc_id].

And that's it, that's all it takes to define a tool. So

we've specified the name of the tool, its description,

the argument that is expected, its type,

and a description for that argument as well. All

these different decorators and field types and whatnot

are all going to be taken together by this Python MCP

SDK, and it's going to generate a JSON

schema for us. Now that we've implemented

this first tool, I'm going to remove the to-do right there.

And then we will implement our other tool, the one to

edit a document. So we're going to repeat

the exact same process. I'll say MCP

dot tool. I'll give it a name of edit_document

with a description of edit a document

by replacing a string in the document's

contents or semi-content with a new string.

Then for the implementation, I'll call this function edit_doc.

Or so we'll be consistent, call it edit_document. And

then we're going to take in a couple of different arguments here. First

is going to be a document ID and then a old

string to find and then a new string to replace

the old string with. So let's write this all

out. We're going to have a doc_id. That

will be a string with a description

of ID of the

document. that will

be edited. old_string will be a string with

a description of the text to replace.

Must match exactly, including

white space. And

then our new_string, the

new text to insert in place of

the old text. So our document editing here is

just a very simple find and replace. That's it. Once

again, inside of here, I'm going to make sure that Claude

is asking for a document that actually exists. So if doc_id not

in docs, raise

value error with an f-string

of doc with id {doc_id} not

found. And then if we do find the correct

document, here's how we will do our edit. We'll say docs

[doc_id] = docs[doc_id].replace(old_string, new_string)

And that's it. All

right. So just like that, we have put together two tool implementations

really, really quickly. I can't repeat it enough, defining

tools with this MCP Python SDK is

a lot easier than writing out the schema definition manually.

Now that we've got both tools put together, I'm going to delete the

Tudu right there. Okay, so this

is a good start. We have put together our MCP

server and we've implemented two tools inside of it.
