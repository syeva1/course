# How computer use works

## Transcript

Now that we have seen a demonstration of computer use, let's

get a better understanding of how computer use actually works

behind the scenes. To help you understand computer use, we're

going to first get a quick reminder on how tool use works

with Claude. So whenever we want to use a tool, we

will make a request off to Claude, including a user

message and some tool schema. This tool schema

describes some additional functionality that we want to expose

to Claude. So in this example, I might send across

a tool schema of something like GitWeather that

would presumably allow Claude to fetch some weather in a particular

location like Navy San Francisco. Claude

is going to take a look at the user's message and realize that it can't

really answer the question by itself. So it's going to decide

to use that GitWeather tool. To use the tool,

Claude will respond with a tool use part. So

this will have a tool use ID, a name, and some

input that it wants to feed into the tool. In this case,

it would probably be a location of San Francisco.

Then our server is going to have some amount of code written

by you and me that will receive that location and then

return the current weather at that spot. We're

going to take that result and send it back to Claude inside

of a tool result part. So we can summarize

this entire process in a diagram like this.

We initially send Claude some kind of question and a list

of tools, Claude decides to use a tool, we run

some code or do something on Claude's behalf, and then

send the result back to Claude. It turns out that Computer

Use follows the exact same flow, because Computer

Use itself is actually implemented with this exact same tool

system. So here's how a computer use actually

works. We send a request off to Claude that includes a

very special tool schema. The schema we send is

very small. It's exactly what you see on the left hand side. And

it doesn't match the typical structure of a tool schema.

Behind the scenes, this schema will be expanded into a much,

much larger structure, like the one you see on the right. And

this larger structure is what actually gets fed

into Claude. This large schema tells Claude

that it can call an action function. And that

the action function takes arguments like mouse move,

left click, screenshot, and more. Claude

might then decide to make use of that tool in some way. So

it will send a tool use part back to us.

Remember what we saw a moment ago with the git weather function.

Whenever Claude decides to use a tool, it is up to us, the

developers, to actually fulfill Claude's tool use

request in some way. So to simulate a computing

environment for Claude, we can set up a Docker container,

running some program that can programmatically execute key

presses and mouse movements. Once we execute

the requested key press or mouse movement, we then

send a response back to Claude. So to summarize, this

is exactly what's going on behind the scenes with computer use.

Claude isn't actually directly manipulating a computer.

Instead, computer use is implemented using

the tool system. And it is up to us to provide

the actual computing environment. The last thing I'd

like to do is tell you how you can get started with computer use on your

own. Luckily, you do not have to create that

Docker container from scratch on your own. Anthropic

has already implemented a reference implementation. This

is a Docker container that already contains code to receive

tool request from Claude and execute programmatic mouse

movements and key presses inside of the container. I've

provided a link to the reference implementation on the left-hand

side. Setting up this implementation is really

easy. All you need to do is get a Docker implementation.

You might already have one installed. You'll execute a simple

Docker command and that's going to give you access to the same

interface I showed you just a moment ago. You can

then chat directly with Claude on the left hand side of the screen and

test out Claude's computer use functionality.
