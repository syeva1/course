# Using multiple tools

## Transcript

The last thing we need to do is add in the Add Duration to

DateTime tool and the Set Reminder tool. This

is going to be a little bit anti-climactic because last

video was rather challenging. This one is going to be really easy,

short and straightforward. Turns out I've already put together

a lot of the code that we need for this inside of the

Tools and Schemas cell. You'll find that

I've already got an implementation of add_duration_to_datetime,

but together inside of here. And if you scroll down, you'll

see I've also got our set_reminder function put together. Now

set_reminder doesn't actually set a reminder or anything like

that. It's just going to print out a statement that says, hey, we

set a reminder at this time with some given content.

I've also provided us a add_duration_to_datetime

schema and a set_reminder schema.

So all we really need to do is pass these two schemas

into Claude, and we also need to make sure that if Claude ever asks

to use either tool, we call the appropriate tool function.

So let's get to it. Should be pretty straightforward.

First off, I'm going to find the run_conversation function.

Inside of here, I'm going to find the list of tools, and I'm going to add into

it, add_duration_to_datetime,

schema and the set_reminder

schema as well. So now Claude is aware of

the existence of these two other tools. Next,

all I have to do is go up a little bit here to

the run_tool function. So this is the function where

we're going to get a tool name and some arguments. All we have

to do is find the appropriate tool function call, call

it, and return result. So adding into the thing

is really easy. Let's add in an if

case. So check and see if the tool name

is add_duration_to_datetime.

And if it is, we'll return a

call to add_duration_to_datetime and **tool_input.

I'll then repeat that for the other tool.

So the tool name is set_reminder, return

set_reminder with **tool_input.

And that's it. So

as soon as you put together this run_tool function and

the run_conversation function, after that initial

difficulty, everything around tool use starts to become really

easy and straightforward, because adding in additional tools

is super simple. Just update run_tool, add

in a tool schema, add in an implementation for the actual

tool function itself, and that's it. You're all done. So

now let's test this out. I'm going to make sure I rerun that cell.

I'm going to rerun run_conversation. And

then down here at the very bottom, let's update our

query. I'm going to ask Claude to set a reminder. And

I'm going to say that the reminder needs to be set 177 days

after January 1st, 2050. This is definitely

going to result in more than one tool call. Claude is going to first

have to add_duration_to_datetime, and then set

a reminder after that. Let's then run this and

see how it does. Claude initially tells us

that it needs to figure out 177 days after January

1st. Once it figures that out, it's then going to attempt

to set the reminder. Then we see a log statement right here.

This log statement is coming from the set_reminder function. Remember,

set_reminder doesn't actually do anything, it just prints out the arguments

that it's given. And then finally, we get a response from Claude

telling us that our appointment has been set on the correct

date of Monday, June 27th of 2050.

We can also go down to the message conversation history.

So once again, we've got the user message, the

assistant right here that has a text block.

And in addition to the text block, once again, a tool

use block. So yet again, we're seeing an example here of a message

with multiple different blocks inside of it. We then respond

with the tool results. We then get some follow up. And from

there, I think you understand the process. All

right, so that's it. We have wired in multiple different tools

to our notebook. Excellent progress.
