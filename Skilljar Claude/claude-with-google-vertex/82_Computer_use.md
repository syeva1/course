# Computer use

## Transcript

Let's take a look at the computer use feature inside

of Claude. We're going to cover this in three different parts. I'm

going to first give you a quick demonstration of computer use and

help you understand why it's useful. We'll then take a look at

some behind the scenes stuff and understand how computer use works,

and then I'll show you how to set up the reference implementation

so you can test out computer use on your own. So let's

get to it. Let's first go over a quick demonstration of

computer use. For this demonstration, I've put together

a very small web application. All it does is

show a text area that supports the ability to

mention a file or some kind of resource using

the at symbol. So if I enter test

and then at, I can scroll through a bunch of different options

and eventually hit enter to select that particular option.

Now, first glance, this thing appears to be working just fine.

I can add in as many different mentions as I

want. But if we use it a little bit more, we'll start

to see a lot of janky behavior. For example,

if I add in two mentions and then press the backspace

key, I'll see that I suddenly get a pop-up on the top

left-hand side of the screen. So it's clear that this thing

doesn't quite work as expected. Now,

I could spend my time as a software engineer to sit

here and figure out all the different cases in which this component

fails. Or, alternatively, I can

delegate this task off to Claude's computer use.

Let me show you how we would do that. Now I have already

set up a computer use environment in this window.

So this is a demo that you and I are going to eventually

set up on your computer a little bit later on inside this section.

On the right hand side is a browser that is running inside

of a Docker container. So this browser is completely

isolated from the rest of my system. And then on

the left hand side, I have a chat interface where I can give direct

instructions to Claude and get Claude to interact

with this browser in some particular way. Inside

of that chat interface, I'm going to enter in a rather large

prompt to Claude. I'm going to tell Claude that it's going

to do some QA testing on a React component

hosted at some particular address. I then

outline some testing process for Claude, and

then some different test cases to go through. And at the very end,

I'm asking Claude to write out a concise report that

summarizes the output of all these different tests. So

again, I'm using Claude computer use here to automate some

QA testing just to save myself some time.

I want to take this big prompt, enter

it into this chat interface, and then Claude

is immediately going to spring into action. Claude

is going to follow us in the instructions I listed inside there, so it's

going to try to navigate to that site where I hosted this

application, and then go through each of those different test cases.

The first test case will just verify that the autocomplete options

appear. The second test case will verify

that pressing Enter will insert a mention. And

the third will make sure that pressing that Backspace key shows

the autocomplete options underneath the mention itself and

not on the top left-hand side. After

all the test cases run, we'll see some output in the chat

window. So it tells me that the first test and the second

test passed, but the third one failed. So again,

this is assigned to me that I probably need to go and investigate

this test case myself and figure out how to fix this. Either

way, Claude's computer use functionality saved me

the developer a lot of time on this QA process.
