To learn more about tools, we are going to set ourselves

a little goal. This is going to be a small project that

we implement inside of a Jupyter notebook. We are going

to try to teach Claude how to set reminders

that occur at some point in time in the future. This

is going to require us to implement several different tools.

And right now, we're just going to focus on one tool at a time,

but just know that we're going to eventually have to deal with multiple

tools. So I want to eventually be able to send

a message to Claude of something like, set a reminder

for my doctor's appointment, it's a week from Thursday.

And I want Claude to respond to something like, okay,

I will remind you at that point in time. When

you first look at this task, you might think it seems really easy,

but it turns out that there are actually several different challenges

that we're going to need to tackle, and we're going to solve all of them

through the use of tools. So in particular,

Claude does know the current date. In other words,

if you open up a prompt right now, you could ask it what the current date is

and it will give you an exactly correct answer.

However, Claude doesn't always know the exact time

of day. So if we were to ask Claude to do something like

set a reminder for 24 hours from now

and expecting it to be exactly

24 hours, Claude doesn't really know what

24 hours from now actually is because it doesn't

know the current time. Secondly, Claude

does not always perfectly handle time-based addition.

So if I were to ask it, what is 379 days

from January 13, 1973? Claude

will very often give you the correct answer, but sometimes

it will get that addition incorrect. And

finally, Claude just doesn't know what it means to set

a reminder, as no concept of it. It does know

conceptually what setting a reminder is, but there's

no mechanism inside of Claude whatsoever for setting

reminders in the future. To solve each

of these issues, we are going to make a dedicated tool.

So we have three issues right here. We are going to make three

separate tools, one at a time. Here's what

each tool is going to do. We're going to have a very

simple tool that we're going to get started with. It's going

to help us understand what tool calling is all about. Its

only job is to get the current date time. So

that means the current date plus the time.

The second tool we will make will add a duration

to a date time. So this will allow us

to say something like take the current date and add

20 days to it and what would the resulting day

be. And then finally, we will make a reminder

setting tool as well.
