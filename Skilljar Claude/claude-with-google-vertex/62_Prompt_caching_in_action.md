# Prompt caching in action

## Transcript

Time to get our hands dirty with prompt caching. I've

created a new notebook called 003 caching.

You will of course find it attached to this lecture. Inside

here, you'll find a section called prompt with 6K

tokens. So this is meant to serve as a system prompt.

We're going to use it in a little bit. In addition, there is a

tool schema section. It has several different tool schemas to

find inside of it. All these different tool schemas put together

total it to about 1.7K tokens.

We're going to work on updating our chat function,

which is inside the cell up here called helper functions. We're

going to make sure that our chat function always enables prompt

caching for our tool schemas and our system

prompt by default. So let me show you how you would

do that. Inside the helper function cell, I'm

going to scroll down to our chat function. Here it is right

here. I'm going to scroll down a little bit further and you'll notice

I added in two to-do items. First,

if a tools list is provided, I want to always cache

the list of tools. Secondly, if we provide a system

prompt, I want to cache that as well. Remember

that we can have multiple different cache breakpoints inside

of a single request. So if we end up passing both

a system prompt and a list of tools, we're going to set two

different cache breakpots. Let's first take care

of caching our list of tools. Now,

to do so, remember, we need to modify the very

last tool schema that we pass into Claude.

We need to, in particular, add on that cache

control field. But we could do something like

this. We could just say tools, negative

one, and then set a cache control

field on it of type ephemeral.

Like so. As we definitely work, but it's not

the best coding technique. You see, this will

actually modify our tool schema by adding in the cache

control field to it. There might be some scenario in

our application where we later on decide to change

the order of our tool schemas that we're passing in. And if

we did so, we would then end up with multiple different cache

breakpoints being set up inside of our tool schema, which

might not be exactly what we desire. So a little

bit better way of doing this would be to

first create a copy of our tools list.

Then we will clone the last tool scheme inside

there and add the cache control field to it. So

let me see how to do that. I'm going to make a new variable

called tools clone, which will come from calling tools.copy.

So that's going to make a total copy of the list. Next,

I'm going to copy the very last tool inside there. I'm

then going to add on the cache control field to

the last tool schema. So

that will be type ephemeral.

Then I'm going to overwrite the last element inside

tools clone with the tool schema copy that

I just made tools. clone

at negative one will be the last tool. And

I'm going to assign my tools clone to

the tools program. Now, just to repeat here really

quickly, all this copulogic I have inside of here is

not strictly necessary. It's just good practice, again,

in case we ever decide to change our list of tools

at some point in time. Next up, we'll take care of the second

to do. So if we pass in a system prompt, I

want to make sure that we always set a cache breakpoint on it. To

do so, I'm going to remove the comment. I will

replace system with a list. We're going to put

inside of here a text block. So we'll be

a dictionary with a type of text,

text of system, and then finally

a cache control type

ephemeral. And that's it. Alright,

so let's now run the cell. We're going to go down to the very bottom

and test out this caching that we have set up. So

down here at the very bottom, I've already defined a list of tools. These

are tool schemas that are defined inside the cell right above. We've

also got that very large system prompt right here

of code prompt. So let's first try just passing

in nothing at all. So no list of tools, no prompt

whatsoever. We're just going to see the number of tokens that are

used to process the message of was one plus one and

generate a response. So if I run this, I'll

get back in output and we can notice that there is a usage

field inside of here. So it looks like we sent in 14 tokens

and we got 11 out. Let's now try adding

in our list of tools. So

when I add that in and run this, we're now going to

see a very different usage field. Now

our usage has a cache creation input tokens

of 1700. That means that Claude has

seen that we want to do cache our schemas. So

it has written into the cache a total of about 1700

tokens. So now if we make a follow-up request

immediately, without changing anything about it, we'll

see that we are now going to read a certain number of tokens

out of our cache. So now we've got a cache read

of 1700. That means that we have successfully

stored our schemas inside the cache and then retrieve

them at some point in time in the future. Now, if

we change our user message here in any way,

maybe by deleting that question mark at the end,

and then rerun this, we are still going to read out

of the cache because remember the caching order is the list

of tools, then our system prompt, and then our different

messages. So we'll still read out of the cache like

so. However, if we change any

of our tools in any way whatsoever, we're

going to invalidate the cache. So if I go to my

list of tools, I'm going to change the

description on the very first tool. I'm going to remove the

S on the word ads. So now let's just add a specified

duration. Now if I rerun cell,

I've changed my tool schema. And that means that

the cache breakpoint that we have applied to all of our different tools

is no longer going to apply. If I run the very bottom

cell again, we'll see an updated value

of usage. So now we're going to have a cache

write once again. So no longer reading. We're now back to

writing because we have sent in a list of tools that

as far as Claude is concerned is completely different.

All right, so now let's try adding in our system prompt. I'm

going to go to our chat function, and I'll add in system

code prompt. So now when we make

this request, remember the order of caching, it is tools,

then the system prompt, and then our list of messages.

Because we are leaving our list of tools completely identical,

but we are changing the system prompt, I would expect to see

a partial cache read and then a cache

write at the same time. The cache read that we're going

to see is because we are making use of the same list of tools. And

the cache write is going to because we are sending up a new

cache breakpoint by sending in this new prompt.

So I'm going to run this. And now we should see a,

there we go, a cache read of 1700 and a

cache write of 6.3. Now,

just like our list of tools, if we go up to our system

prompt and we change this prompt in any way, maybe

by just removing the word builder at the very end here

and then rerunning that cell. Now, once again, as far

as Claude is concerned, if we send in another request,

this will be a completely different system prompt.

So we are going to lose out on all the cache data we had

previously around the system prompt. So now I'll send

this again, and we will once again see a cache

read of about 1.7, there

we go. And then we are once again writing this brand

new system prompt, so that's another 6.3. All

right, my friends, that is prompt caching. Again, you're

going to very often use prompt caching anytime you are sending

in identical content, either in the form of the same

list of messages, the same tool schemas, or the same

system prompt.
