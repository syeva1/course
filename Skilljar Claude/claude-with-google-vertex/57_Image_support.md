# Image support

## Transcript

The next advanced capability of Claude that we are going to

investigate is Claude's vision capabilities. Whenever

we send a user message off to Claude, we can optionally include

images inside of the message. We can then ask Claude

to do just about anything you can possibly imagine with these images.

So we could ask Claude to tell us what is contained inside them. We

could ask Claude to compare different images. We can ask Claude

to count different objects. Really, there's a lot of

different possibilities here. The first thing I want you to understand

around image handling is some of the different restrictions or requirements.

We can send up to 100 images across all

the messages inside of a single request. There

are some limitations around the size of each image and

the height and width as well. And

finally, you need to understand that whenever you send an image off to

Claude, that is going to count for some number of tokens

that you are going to be charged for. There is an equation you

can use to roughly calculate how many tokens you'll be charged for

based upon the height and the width of the image in pixels.

To send an image off to Claude, we are going to include yet

another type of block inside of a user

message. This is an image block. We can attach

multiple different image blocks inside of one single user

message. Each image block is going to hold a reference

to a single image. Inside this image block, we

can attach either the raw image data, which

is what I showed in this diagram over here on the right-hand side, or

alternatively, we can provide a URL to an image

that is hosted somewhere online. So now that we understand

some of the technical limitations here and how we send

the image off, there's something really important that I want

to address right away. Whenever an engineer

starts making use of images with Claude, well, I

notice very often they start using prompts that are very

simple, even kind of like the prompt I've gotten this example

right here. The number one way to get good

results out of Claude when you are making use of images is

to continue to have a strong focus on prompting

techniques. So if you just throw an image off

to Claude and then put in a very simple prompt, very

often you are not going to get back a good result. For

example, consider the conversation on the right-hand side. I

put in an image with 12 marbles. I actually

tested this by the way and I asked it very simply how

many marbles are in this image. And sure enough, I got back

an incorrect count of 13. We can

dramatically increase Claude's accuracy when

working with images by using the same kind of

prompting techniques that we've already learned earlier on inside

this course. So techniques like providing

guidelines, providing analysis steps, or by using

one shot or even multi-shot examples. So

let me show you two ways in which we could very easily enhance

this prompt and actually get back the correct result. And

again, I actually tested this out and made sure that these examples,

at least for me, worked as expected. So

the first thing we might do is provide a series of steps

for Claude to go through in analyzing the image. Now,

of course, this is only really going to work if we kind of already

understand the content of the image that we're feeding into Claude.

So in this scenario, I might ask Claude to first take

a look and try to identify each individual marble

and just count each of them one by one. and then ask

it to recount a second time to verify

the initial count and provide it a different mechanism

or different strategy for counting the number of marbles.

And then finally at the bottom, I ask, okay, now let's kind of compare

those two different counts and figure out what the correct

answer is. So by providing a more sophisticated

prompt, I was able to get results with a correct count of

12 marbles. Another technique

we might use here is one shot or multi-shot

prompting. So here's how that would work.

Inside of my user message, I can alternate

the presence of an image part and a text part.

So in this scenario, I have an image part up here, a

text part underneath it, and then another image, and

then a text part. In the initial pair,

I provide an image with 11 marbles, and then say very

plainly, the image above has 11 marbles inside

of it. Providing an example like this can easily improve

Claude's accuracy when it goes to tackle your image

later on. As usual, I would like to test

out this feature in Claude inside of a Jupyter notebook. But

this time around, we're going to have a little bit more complicated example.

And I want you to understand the scenario that we're going to walk

through here inside of our notebook ahead of time by showing

you a quick diagram. All right, so here is a

sample use case of how we might use Claude's

image support capability. So in case you're not aware,

in many parts of the United States, we have really

bad wildfire problems, where wildfire

will begin sweeping through an area and burn down a

ton of houses. And because this is a very

common risk, a lot of people want fire insurance to

ensure their home in case it gets burned down. But

these insurers are very much aware that a house

can absolutely be burned down tomorrow or next year

or very shortly. So these insurers

will very often require a homeowner who wants

to insure their home to trim trees or even

cut trees down entirely around their house.

Now the insurer needs to actually verify and make sure

that the homeowner is taking care of the trees appropriately.

But to verify that, they might have to send out a person to inspect

each property and probably do that inspection maybe once

every year or once every two years. That would become expensive

really, really quickly. So one way that we can automate

this process is by getting high resolution up

to date satellite imagery and then feed it into

Claude and ask Claude for a fire risk assessment.

We might ask Claude in particular to try to detect

the main residence on the property. So in other words, inside

of a satellite image of a property, find the main

home that is presumably insured. And then take

a look for maybe tree branches that are overhanging

the residence, which is a very common risk of fire.

Maybe try to gauge how difficult it is for

fire services to actually access the residence.

So make sure in other words, there's kind of a clear path to get to the

home and also take a look at the trees around

the home and make sure that they are not too closely or

tightly packed, which in its own right could be a

fire risk as well. All right, so let's go

over to the notebook and see how we could implement this. I'm

inside of a new notebook called 002 images.

Inside of here, I have already put together a starter prompt for

us. Now notice that this prompt is highly

detailed and walks Claude through different points

or different ideas that I want analyzed inside the image. I

could have written out a very simple prompt of something like provide

a fire score based upon the satellite image of this

property and just left it there. I can almost guarantee

you I would not get a good result. So instead,

I applied some of the different prompt engineering techniques

we've learned about previously, and I provided a series

of different analysis steps for Claude to go through. Step

1. First, find the actual primary residence

inside of the satellite photo. Step 2. Take

a look at the tree density. Then take a look

at the ability for fire services to actually access

the property. Take a look at how many

trees or specifically branches are overhanging the

roof, which is a very common fire risk,

and then finally assign a fire risk rating based

upon all these different qualities. And I provide some criteria

on helping it decide whether it should be a 1, 2, 3,

or 4. And then finally at the very bottom, write

a one-sentence summary for each with a final score.

So that's our prompt. I'm going to make sure I run

that cell. And then let's go down here to the bottom. And

we're going to write out some code to read in a sample

image and feed it into Claude with that prompt and

see what kind of result we get. One other quick item. Attach

to this lecture, you will find a zip archive called images.zip.

Make sure you extract that archive and place the images directory

into the same folder as your notebook. This folder contains

some different satellite imagery of different houses with some number

of trees around it. So for example, Image 1 has a house

with definitely a good amount of tree overhang. Image

2 has definitely a lot less trees,

but there's still a little bit close tree right here to the property. And

you can go through the rest and just verify that, yeah, we've definitely

got some satellite imagery here. So our goal is going to

be to send these different images into Claude and get a fire

score rating for each. Back inside my notebook, I'm

going to first begin by opening up an image file and converting

its contents into base 64. So I'll

do a width open. In the images directory,

I'm going to look for image seven specifically. And

I'm using that image in particular because it is absolutely

surrounded by trees. So here's prop

seven.png. As you can see, definitely a lot of

issues with fire here. I'm

going to get the image bytes as base 64,

standard_b64 and

code. I'm going to pass an F dot

read and I'll decode into

utf-8. I'm then going to

add in an empty list of messages. I'll

add a user message into it. And

this message that I am adding in is going to have two separate blocks.

It is first going to have an image block, exactly with the structure

that you see right here, and it will have a text block.

And a text block is going to contain the actual directions that

I want to feed into Claude. So I'll

add in first a dictionary to represent the image block.

So a type of image with

a nested dictionary assigned to source that has

a type of base 64, a

media_type of image/

png. and data that's going

to be the image bytes encoded as base 64.

Then after that dictionary, I'll add in my actual prompt.

So I'll give this a type of text. And

then the prompt that I want to send in, I assign to the prompt

variable right there. So

I'll do a text of

prompt. All right, finally, I'll

call chat and pass in my list of messages. I'm

going to run this and let's see what we get. Looking

at the response, I'm going to scroll down to the very bottom and I should see

a fire risk rating. In this case, I got a fire

risk of high or a score in particular

of three. So I think Claude did a pretty reasonable job

of evaluating all the trees around the main property and

deciding that, yeah, there's probably going to be an issue here. Before

we move on, there is one last thing I want to remind you around images.

Getting good results out of Claude when feeding images in

all comes down to your prompting technique. Just as we examined

a lot of different ways of improving your prompt when using

plain text, those same techniques apply to the world

of images as well. So I would really encourage you

to always make sure that you put together a very well-developed and

well-evaluated prompt. Because if you rely upon

simple prompts like what I'm putting in right here, it's

probably not going to work quite as well as you might expect.
