# Agents and tools

## Transcript

Now that we have taken a look at several different workflows, we are going

to pivot and start to discuss agents. Understanding

agents is easiest if you think back to workflows, specifically

when we would actually use them. Workflows were most

effective when we knew the precise series of steps required

to complete a given task. Agents, on the other

hand, are more effective when we don't really know exactly

what steps are required. So in these scenarios,

we give Claude a task and a set of tools. And

then we rely upon Claude to create a plan to

complete the task using the given tools. This

flexibility around agents is what makes them really attractive

for building. The thought process is that you can make an agent, make

sure it works reasonably well, and then the agent can solve

a wide variety of different tasks. However, there

are some major drawbacks to this approach, which we will discuss

in a little bit. A key aspect of agents

is their ability to make use of tools in different combinations.

So to help you understand this, I want to think back to an earlier example

that we went through earlier on inside this course, where we put

together three different tools. We created tools like

Get Current Date Time, Add Duration to Date Time, and

Set Reminder. Each of these tools were rather simple

in nature, but Claude was able to combine them in different,

kind of surprising ways to achieve a wide variety of

different tasks that we might not really have planned out ahead

of time. Let me show you some examples.

So on the left hand side of this diagram, I've got some example

tasks that we could feed into Claude along with those three

different tools. And then on the right hand portion is

a series of different tool calls that Claude might make to

complete the given task. So for example, if we ask

Claude what's the given time, easy enough, Claude can

just call the Get Current Date Time tool by itself and

answer the question. If we ask Claude what day

of the week is in 11 days, it could first call Get

Current Date Time and then Add Duration to Date Time.

If we ask Claude to say, set a reminder to go

to the gym next Wednesday, Claude could first figure

out the current day of the week, add a duration onto it,

and then Set Reminder for that particular day. Finally,

Claude can also figure out when it needs some extra information in

order to successfully call a tool. So if a user

asks, when does my 90-day warranty expire? Well,

there's really no guarantee that the user got the warranty today.

So Claude might first ask the user for a bit of extra

information, particularly when they actually obtain the

warranty. Once the user gives them that information, then

Claude can call Add Duration to Date Time and figure out when

the warranty will expire. These are all examples

of ways in which Claude can take a set of tools and

combine them together in an interesting fashion in order to solve

a given task. And this is going to lead us into our first

big lesson or understanding around agents. And

that is that the set of tools we provide to an agent

need to be a reasonably abstract. And a great

example of this and to help you understand what I really mean hereby

abstract is to go back and look at Claude code and

specifically some of the tools that are provided to it.

Claude Code gets access to a very small set of

abstract tools. And when I say abstract, I

mean generic or general or kind of vague in

purpose. They are not hyper specialized in any

way. So Claude Code gets access to tools like

Bash in order to run commands, web fetch to

fetch URL, write to create a file, and so

on. And Claude Code can figure out how to modify

and add features to an existing codebase in

really amazing ways by combining together these different tools.

Claude Code does not have access to hyper-specialized

tools that just fulfill one very specific

task in one specific scenario. So for example,

on the right-hand side of this diagram, these are all tools that Claude

Code notably does not have. So there is no refactor

tool that will just magically refactor a file.

Instead, Claude Code should figure out how to make use of

the tools on the left-hand side in order to refactor something.

Likewise, there is no install dependencies tool. Instead,

Claude Code needs to read files to understand the project configuration

and then run the Bash tool to run the appropriate command to install

the dependencies. The lesson that we can take from this

is that whenever we create an agent, we want to make sure that

we provide reasonably abstract tools that

Claude can somehow figure out how to piece together in order

to achieve some goal. So for example,

if we go back to our example of building some kind of social media

video creation agent, we might provide

it for different tools. One might be Bash,

which would give it access to FFmpeg. That's

a commonly used CLI tool that you can use to generate videos,

given some input images or videos or text or

audio and so on. We might also give it a Generate

Image tool, a text to speech tool, just to augment

the video generation process, and then finally, a Post

Media tool so that it can take the generated

content, whatever it made, and post that content

to a social media account. Claude can use

that set of tools in rather unexpected ways. So

for example, it would enable a flow like what you see on the left-hand

side, where a user might chat with our agent and

ask it to create and post a video on Python programming.

But this set of tools might also allow for more dynamic

interactions with the user. For example, on the right-hand side,

a user might ask for a video, but first ask the agent

to generate a sample cover image to use in the

video. Then our agent could first generate an

image, show it to the user, get the user's approval, and

then go into the video generation process.
