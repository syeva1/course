# Tools for structured data

## Transcript

Earlier on inside this course, we spoke about how to get structured

output from Claude by using some clever techniques.

In particular, we discussed using a message pre-fill

and stop sequences, along with a carefully structured

prompt in order to get some JSON out of Claude.

Now, this definitely worked well, and it was very

easy to set up, but we can get some more reliable

output by a very clever use of tools.

So we're going to take a look at how we can implement structured

output using tools alone without having to

worry about any message prefilling or stop sequences. Now,

I anticipate one of your very first questions is going

to be, why did we learn about this style

of structured output when we could have just used tools all along?

Well, the answer is very simple. Using tools for structured

output is a lot more set up. There's a lot more complexity.

So having both these abilities of getting structured

data at your disposal is really valuable because

in some scenarios, you might want to just make use of this prompt

based structured output. In other scenarios, you might want

to make use of tools. All right, so let's take a look at how

we can make use of tools to generate structured data. Now,

as I just mentioned, this is an alternate method of extracting

structured data, primarily JSON, out of some

data source. This is more reliable than past techniques

we took a look at, but again, much more complex

to set up. The general idea here is that we are going

to write out a JSON schema spec for a tool

whose inputs are going to be the structure

of data that we are looking for. So back

over here a moment ago, when we looked at this prompt, we can imagine

that we were asking Claude to take a look at a financial statement

and extract a balance that was an integer and

a list of key insights that was going to be a list of strings.

So if we wanted to approach this using tool-based

structured outputs, we would write out a JSON schema

spec where the inputs would be a balance that's

going to be an integer and key insights that's going

to be a list of strings. Then

we're going to feed this JSON schema spec into

Claude along with the financial data that we might want to

get some information out of. Now, at this point, let me show

you a diagram of the flow because it's a lot easier

to understand in diagram format. Okay,

so just as before, we are going to write out a reasonable

prompt for Claude. So we might say, analyze a filing

financial statement and then call some provided tool. Along

with this prompt, with all the statement data inside of it, we'll

also provide that schema. So that's going

to go off to Claude. Claude is going to take a look at the prompt.

It's going to see the tool that is available to it and it's going to say,

ah, fantastic. I will call this financial analysis

tool and I'll make sure that I provide arguments that

match this structure right here. So

Claude is then going to respond back to us with a tool use block.

Inside that block, it's going to ask to call the financial analysis

tool. And the input to it is going to be the exact

input that we specified inside of this financial

analysis schema. So we will get back a balance

that's an integer and key insights that's a list

of strengths. Once we've got that data, we are all done.

So unlike usual tool calls where we would usually

respond with a tool-result block, we don't have

to do that here because our only goal was to get the extracted

JSON right here. That's it. So once we get the

assisted message in response, we kind of just

say to Claude, thanks to the JSON, we're done and we're

not going to make any more follow-up requests. The last thing

I want to mention is that a critical part of this technique is

to make sure that Claude calls the tool that we have provided

to it. To force Claude to call a specific tool,

we can provide a tool choice parameter when

we call the clientmessages.create function. Specifically,

we can provide a tool choice that is a dictionary with

a type of tool and the name of the tool

that we want to force Claude to call. So in

this case, if we provide a schema that has

a name of analyze financial statement, we would

put in analyze financial statement right there like so.

Now that we've got an idea of how all this works, let's go back

over to our notebook and get some hands-on experience.

Back over here, I'm inside of a new notebook called 002

Structured Data, and it should be attached to this lecture. It

has all the same code as the previous notebook we were working

on. The only difference is I added in this additional cell down

here at the bottom. This cell is going to ask Claude

to write a one paragraph scholarly article about computer

science and to include a title and author name.

I'm going to run this really quick and just take a look at the generated

article. This article has a title and

author name, and then some text to go along

with it. So I want to try to extract some JSON

data out of this text. In particular, I want to

extract the title as a string, the

author as a string, and then I want to extract a

list of strings that contain some key insights

out of the article. To do so, we are going to write out a

schema definition for a new tool. Our schema

is going to make it clear to Claude that in order to call that

tool, it must provide arguments of a title

that's a string, an author that's a string, and then a

list of key insights. There are going to be a list of strings as

well. And remember, the easiest way to put

together a new tool definition is to make use

of Claude itself. So I once again have opened

up my browser. I've got the documentation open

on tool use right here. I'm going to again just copy the page.

I'm going to ask Claude to write out a tool schema for a function

named Article Summary. And this function should

be called with a title, this is string, an author that is a

string, and a list of key insights. I'm

going to paste in the documentation and

run this. In response, I'll get back my article summary

tool definition. So I'm now going to copy this,

take it back over to my notebook. I'm going to go up to

the cell that has all of our other tools and schemas. I'm

going to paste it in here and I'm going to call

it article summary schema.

There we go. I'll make sure I run that cell as well. The

next thing I would like to do is update our chat function implementation.

So in the cell right above, helper functions, I'll

find the chat function. Remember that a key aspect

of this JSON extraction operation is ensuring that Claude

always calls your specific tool that you have made. So

we want to make sure that our chat function can take in a tool

choice argument, and that the tool choice will be passed

on through to our actual client messages

create function call. So back over here,

I'm going to add in yet another argument of tool

choice. And again, I'll default it to be none. We're

then going to set it up in the same way that we set up tools right here. So

if a tool choice is provided, then

params.tool_choice is

going to be tool_choice. I'll make sure I

run this cell as well. And I think we have everything

we need to do a little test here. At the very bottom of my

notebook, I'm going to add in a new cell. So

down here, I'll add in messages. I'll

add a user message.

And I want to add in the text that we just got back from the

previous cell's response right here. So I'm going to add

in some text

from message, response. So

that's going to take all the text out of this response and

add in as a plain user message. I'm

going to call chat with a list of messages. Then

we need to provide our list of tools, which is going to be just

the article summary.

schema. And then finally, we want to force

Claude to call that particular tool. So we'll put

in a tool choice, which

will be a dictionary with a type of

tool and a name of article

_summary. And then I'm going to save

this file just to reformat the code. There we go. That looks

a little bit better. All right, let's now

run this and see what we get back. Inside of the

response message, we have a tool use block that

has a inputs as usual. And the inputs here

is going to be a dictionary with all the data that we asked for.

So there is a title, there is an author, and

then key insights, which is going to be a list of

different strings. So if we wanted to just access

that data alone, we could assign the results

of calling chat to response and then print out response.

content[0].input like so. So let me

run this again and now we've got our structured data.
