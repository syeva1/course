# Overview of Claude models

## Transcript

In this video, we are going to examine Claude's

three model families and understand which one is right

for your specific use case. To help you understand how

these models differ, I'm going to walk you through each

model's key characteristics and then show you a simple

framework for picking the right one. Before we

dive into the specifics, let me make one thing clear. All

three of these models share Claude's core capabilities, so

they can all handle text generation, coding, image

analysis, and many other tasks. The real

difference between them is how they are optimized. One

is built to focus on intelligence, one for speed and

cost efficiency, and one for more of a balance

between intelligence and speed. The first is

Opus. Opus is Claude's most capable

model. And when I say capable, I need to say that this is a

model that delivers the highest level intelligence that you

can get out of Claude. In practice, that means

that Opus is designed for scenarios where you have complex

requirements that need a high level of intelligence and

planning to complete. It can work independently on

complex projects for a long period of time, like

a task that can run on for several hours where the model

needs to manage multi-step processes and navigate

a lot of different requirements on its own without a lot of

human intervention. Opus supports what we call

reasoning, which means it can provide a quick response

for simple tasks or it can spend some time thinking

for a more complex task. The downside

is that Opus has a moderate latency and a

higher cost, and that's really the trade-off that you are making.

While you get really high intelligence, it also takes a little

bit more time and cost for every request that you make.

Next up is Sonnet. Sonnet sits in a kind of

sweet spot in Claude's lineup. It has a good balance

of intelligence, speed, and cost that makes

it really useful for most practical use cases.

What makes Sonnet great is its strong coding ability, along

with its fast text generation. Many developers

like its ability to make precise edits to complex

code bases, meaning it can make changes to a project

without breaking a lot of existing functionality. Finally,

we have Haiku. Haiku is Claude's fastest

model, and it's made specifically for applications where

response time is really important. One important

thing to note around Haiku is that it doesn't support the reasoning

capabilities that Opus and Sonnet have. Instead,

Haiku is optimized for speed and cost efficiency.

And this makes Haiku a really good choice for user-facing

apps that need some real-time interactions.

Now let's talk about how you decide which of these three models

to use for your particular application. The way to

think about model selection really comes down to understanding the

trade-off between these different models. On

the one hand side you've got really high intelligence and

on the other side you've got more cost and speed.

Opus sits on the intelligence side. It's really intelligent,

more expensive, and also has higher latency. Haiku

sits on the cost and speed side. It has

moderate intelligence, low cost, and the highest speed. And

Sonnet is right there in the middle, striking a good balance between

these different qualities. So here's how you decide which

model to use. You really need to identify or figure

out what matters most for your specific use case. If

intelligence is your top priority, meaning you have a

complex task that needs really strong reasoning, then

you probably want to make use of Opus. You are choosing

quality, over speed, and cost. If speed is

your priority, meaning you have real-time user interactions,

or you've got some high-volume processing, where you need to get some

responses back as fast as possible, then you want to choose

Haiku. If you need more of a balance between intelligence,

speed, and cost, which is often the case for most

applications, then Sonnet is probably your best choice.

One important thing to note here is that many teams don't

just pick one model and stick with it. Instead, you

might use multiple different models in the same application.

You might use Haiku for user-facing interactions

where speed is really important, maybe Sonnet for your

main business logic, and Opus for the really complex

tasks that need some deeper reasoning. So that covers

Claude's three model families and how to choose between

them. Just so you know, we are most often going to use Claude

Sonnet in this course just because it gives us a really

fantastic balance of these three different qualities.
