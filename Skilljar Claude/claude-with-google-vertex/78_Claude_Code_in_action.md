# Claude Code in action

## Transcript

To get you some hands-on experience with Claude Code, I

created a small project for us to work on. You should find

the source for this project in a zip file attached to this lecture.

I would encourage you to download this zip, extract its

contents, and then start up your code editor inside of this

new project directory. I've already opened up the project inside

of my editor. And once you have the project open, you might

be tempted to look through the project contents and maybe go

through a little bit of setup which is described inside the

ReadMe file. But before you do, there's

something important I would like you to understand about

Claude Code. Claude Code is not

a tool that is just going to write code for you.

Naturally, it absolutely can, but that's not the only thing

that Claude Code is about. Instead, you really want to

view Claude Code as another engineer who's

working on this project alongside you. Every

task that you would normally go through on a normal project can

really be fully delegated off to Claude. So

this includes everything from initially setting up a project

to designing new features, to deployment, and to support.

As we go through this project, we're going to leverage

Claude heavily to aid us in various steps. We

will use Claude to set up the project for us, to

plan out a new feature, to write tests and code, and

then later on, on a slightly different project, I'll show you how

we can use Claude Code to automatically discover and

fix errors in a production environment. So

let's get to it. Back inside my editor, I'm going

to open up my terminal and then launch Claude

Code inside there by executing Claude.

Then once I have this open, I'm going to put in my first directive

to Claude. I'm going to ask it to read the contents of

the ReadMe file and go through any

setup directions that are listed inside of here. I

will ask Claude to read the contents of the ReadMe file and

execute these setup directions listed in it. Claude

will then use a variety of different tools to read that file

and then execute a series of different commands. It will create

a new virtual environment, activate the environment, and

install some dependencies. Once that is complete,

we are going to run a command that will help Claude get a better understanding

of our project. We're going to do so by running the init

command. This is a command that we're going to execute inside

of Claude Code itself. When you execute this command,

Claude will automatically scan your code base to understand

your project's general architecture, coding style, and

so on. Once complete, Claude will write

all of its findings into a special file named Claude.MD.

Whenever we run Claude again in the future, this file

will be automatically included as context. And

just so you know, there are three different Claude files, Project

Local and User. We're going to see some references to these

in a minute. So we'll discuss what they're all about then. Whenever

you run this init command, you can also actually add

in some special directions for some areas for Claude

to focus on. So let's try this out right now and

see what is generated for our project. I'm going

to run the init command, and when I do, I'm going to pass in some

special instructions. I'm going to ask Claude to include

some detailed notes on defining MCP tools. Once

it is all done, I'm going to take a look at the newly generated

Claude.MD file. So this is a summary of

what Claude thinks of our codebase. At the top, it will list

out some important commands that it might need to run in the future. We'll

get some listing around our coding style that we've used inside this

project. And then as I specially requested, it

also included some information around defining MCP

tools. As I mentioned a moment ago, this file is going

to be included as context for Claude in any follow-up

request we make in the future. Now, projects

change over time. We might change our coding style

or add in some additional commands. So if that ever happens,

we can very easily manually edit this file, or

we can choose to rerun the init command. If

you rerun this command, Claude will update the contents

of the Claude MD file. Finally, as a very

small shortcut, we can put in a Pound and

then type in some specific note that we want to be appended

into the contents of that file. So we can use this as

a tool to give very specific small directions to Claude

that will be included in all follow-up requests. So

for me, I might add in a direction here that says something

like always apply appropriate

types to function args.

And if I run that, I'll then be asked where I want to add

this little note. This is where we see that project memory,

local memory, and user memory appear. In my case,

this is a note that I want to be shared with everyone who is working

on this project, so I will add it to project memory.

Once I add that in, I can then check the contents of my Claude.md

file, and either somewhere under Code

Style or perhaps at the very bottom, I'll probably see whatever

note I just added in. At this point, we have

added a new file to our project, and this project

is being managed by Git. So normally, we would open

up our terminal, stage this new file that we just

created into Git, and then commit those changes. We

could do all that manually, but it'd be a lot faster if we just

asked Claude to do it for us. So I'll ask Claude

to stage and commit all changes.

Claude will then take a look at all the different changes we have made to

the codebase, write a descriptive commit message,

and commit those files. Next up, I would

like to show you some techniques for increasing Claude's effectiveness

when writing code. We are going to add a new feature into

this project. As a reminder, this project is a very

small, very simple MCP server. We

are going to ask Claude to add in a new tool to the server

that will read a Word document or a PDF file

and convert the contents to Markdown. Now, we

absolutely could just type in directions for

that to Claude, something like make a Word doc plus

PDF file to Markdown conversion tool. But

before doing that, I want you to know that we can dramatically

increase the effectiveness of Claude by putting

in a little bit more effort. So let me show you how.

Think of Claude Code as being an effort multiplier.

If you put a little effort into how you direct Claude,

you will get back significantly better results. I'm

going to show you two different workflows, two different ways

of instructing Claude on how to approach a task. Both

of these workflows require a little bit of effort on your side,

but they allow Claude to tackle much more complex

problems. In this first workflow, we're

going to go through three distinct steps. First, we're

going to identify some areas of our code base that we know are

relevant to a feature that we are trying to work on. We're

then going to ask Claude to specifically read and analyze

those files. Second, we're going to tell

Claude about the feature we want to build and ask it to

plan out a solution. So the steps will actually

go through to implement whatever feature or problem you're

trying to solve. And then finally, after Claude

has gone through that planning step, we will ask Claude to actually

implement these solutions. Let me show you how we would do

this for our particular feature of adding in some

new document conversion tool. So

first, I'm going to go through my codebase and identify some different relevant

files. You'll notice there is a Tools directory,

and inside there is a Math.py file. This

is an example of a tool that has already been put together. So

this might be some file that is relevant for the feature that

we are trying to build, just because it gives Claude a

better idea of how to author a tool.

Second, we might ask Claude to take a look at the document.py

file, which includes a very helpful function,

binary document to markdown. So this will take

in some amount of binary data and convert it to markdown.

So we can tell Claude to take a look at these files, and

Claude will get a better idea of how to write a tool in the first

place, and then how to actually do the conversion. So

I'm going to add in some instructions to Claude and

ask it to just read the contents of those files.

Next, I'm going to ask Claude to plan out the implementation of

a new tool called Document Path to Markdown, which

will take in a path to a PDF or Word document,

read the file, convert the contents to Markdown, and return the

results. I'm also going to tell Claude specifically

to just plan the feature out and not to write any code just

yet. In response, Claude is going to give us a

pretty well detailed plan that's going to go through

a couple of different steps that will be required to implement this entire

thing. Finally, I will ask Claude to implement

this plan. It's first going to update the document.py

file, which is definitely correct. It's then going to

update the main.py file, which is also good.

And then finally, it will author a test around this new tool.

It's then going to run the test suite and make sure that the test actually

passes. You'll notice that in the summary message,

Claude also tells me that added in some error handling for

non-existent or unsupported file types, which was

definitely appropriate, even though it wasn't something

that I actually asked for explicitly inside of my description

of this feature. I'd like to show you another way that

we could have asked Claude to implement this feature. Before

I show you this alternative, I'm going to get Claude to remove

all the code that it just wrote by stashing these

changes. Now I am back to a clean

slate where I don't have anything related to that new feature

that was just implemented. The second technique

that we are going to explore is a test-driven development workflow.

Again, this requires some more effort from you up front,

but it dramatically increases Claude's effectiveness. With

this workflow, we will again ask Claude to take a look at some relevant

context. Then, before writing any code,

we're going to ask Claude to think of some different tests

it could write related to our feature. Next,

we will select the most relevant tests and ask Claude

to implement them. Finally, after we have got

some working tests put together, we will ask Claude

to write out a solution and write code until

the tests actually pass. So let me show

you how this approach would actually look for the same exact

feature, one where we are building a tool that's going

to read a document off of our hard drive and

convert contents into Markdown. First,

I'm going to run the slash clear command. This

is going to clear up my conversation history with Claude, essentially

reset its context. In this case, I'm doing

this just so it doesn't cheat off its previous solution. Then

I will ask Claude to read those two relevant files once again.

Then I'm going to add in some very clear instructions to think

of some tests that it might write to evaluate this new feature

that we want to build. Again, I'm going to ask it specifically

to not write any code just yet. The

suggestions I get back are really solid. Now, I don't

really want to have to worry about tests 6, 7, and 8 because

those are a little bit more specialized beyond what

we're doing right now. So I'm going to ask Claude to just implement

tests one through five. Now

we will move on to the last step, where we will ask Claude to write

out some code to make these tests pass. Very

good, all the tests pass. Now, before we move

on, I just want to remind you one more time that Claude Code

really is an effort multiplier. You can

put in very simple directions, and Claude will do its best. But

you can dramatically increase Claude's effectiveness by putting

in a little bit of effort on your side as well.
