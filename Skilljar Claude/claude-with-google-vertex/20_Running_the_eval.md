# Running the eval

## Transcript

With our data set generation complete, we

now need to take every record in that data set, which we're

going to refer to as a test case. So we're going to take

each test case and merge it with the prompt. We're

then going to take the result and feed it into Claude. And

then once we have all these different outputs, we're going to feed them

through our grader. Remember, we have not discussed

graders just yet. Don't worry, that's going to come up very

quickly. And once again, just to save a little bit of

time, I've written out a little bit of code here just

to help guide this next phase of our

workflow. I put together three separate functions

with a very clear comment on what each one does. The

first one that's easiest to understand is the run prompt

function. This is going to be called with a test case.

And those JSON objects we generated just

a moment ago, each of these is a test case. So

you can imagine that each of these one by one are

going to flow into the run prompt function. So

inside of here, our goal is to merge that task

that we generated with our prompt, generate

some text with Claude, and then return the result. So

let's do that right away. I'm going to

put in my V1 prompt

right here, which

is very simple. Remember, we are starting off as simple as possible

here. So it'll just say something like, please

solve the following task.

And I want this to be a F string and I'm

going to put in test case task.

Next up, we want to send this off to Claude. So I'll make a list

of messages. I'll add in a user message.

I'm then going to pass this off to Claude by calling chat.

And we're going to get back some resulting text, some result,

or maybe we'll call it output this time around. And then for right now,

I'll just return the output. Now remember,

we don't have any kind of formatting included or any

formatting instructions inside the prompt right now. So we're

going to probably get back a lot more output than we

ever asked for. The real goal of our prompt

is to make sure that we get just Python or JSON

or that regular expression. And we don't have anything for

that right now. So we'll almost definitely have to come back and make

some improvements. But for right now, we at least have

a start to run prompt. The

next thing we're going to work on is run test case.

The goal of this function is to take in one of those individual

cases, call the run prompt function

we just put together, get some output from Claude, and then grade

the result and return a dictionary describing

the and everything that happened there. Now

that sounds really complicated, but in reality, it's

going to be surprisingly simple. So let me show you all we have to do

here. We're going to put in output

that's going to come from calling the function that we were just working

on a moment ago. So this run prompt function. Put

in our test case and then we're going to do some grading

right here that's going to be a to do.

Right now, I'll just say that we have a hard coded score of 10. So

we definitely have to come back and do a lot of heavy

lifting right there. And then at the bottom, we're just going to

return some information that summarizes everything about running

this test case. So I'll return a dictionary with

some output. Give me whatever got back from Claude.

I'll include the test case. And

then our score. And

then one final step here, we have to implement RunEval.

So this function is going to load up our data set or

receive it as an argument, either one is fine. And then

we're going to loop through that data set. And for every test case, we

will call run test case and then just assemble

all the results together. So

for our implementation here, I'll say results.

It's going to start off as an empty list. And

for every test case in data

set, I'm going to get our

result. from

calling run test case

and pass in the test case to it. And

then add that into our list of results. And

then down here, I'm just going to print up all

of our results. Actually, let's actually just go ahead and return

results. That's a little bit better. Okay,

so there's the outline for our three major functions.

Now believe it or not, this is like a vast majority

of what a Eval pipeline is. We just put together the

vast majority with the obvious exception of grading. So

as you can see, there's not a whole lot of code that goes into this.

Let's now test this out. So

down here in the next cell down, I'm going to go into open

up our data set JSON file. And

parse it as JSON. And

then call the runEval function.

That's the one that we were just putting together right here with

the entire data set. Finally,

I'm going to assign the result to that to results.

I'm going to rerun all the cells above, just to make sure

that I executed all of them, and then I'm going to run

the cell. We'll see what happens. And just so you know,

the first time you run this, it is going to take a pretty good amount

of time, even if you are using high-coup. It's

going to end up taking me about 31 seconds to complete

this with high-coup. I'm going to show you some techniques for

speeding up our Eval run time, but for right now, we're just

going to have it take a little bit longer, but don't worry, we will speed it up.

So now let's take a look at results and see what we have. Results

is going to be a rather large JSON object. So I'm going to print

it out really nicely with a print, JSON

dumps, with results,

and an indent of two. There

we go. So now we get an array of objects. Every

object represents the output from one of our

individual test cases. I've got the output

right here. That's the output coming from Claude. And we can see there

is a lot of stuff generated here. And

if I scroll down a little bit, I'll see

the definition of the test case that this was based upon. And

then the score, which again right now is just hard coded at

10. And then that's just going to repeat over and

over again. All right, so at this point in time, we

have successfully gone through this step

right here. We merged together our data

set with our test prompt and we got some output

from Claude and we kind of collated all this stuff together.

So now the last thing we really have to do here is take

the input and the result that we got out of Claude

and feed it into one of these different graders. So

this finally is the time where we're going to start to learn

about graders. We're going to start to discuss them in the

next video.
