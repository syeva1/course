# Accessing the API

## Transcript

In this module, we are going to examine how we access Claude

and use it to generate some text. To help you understand how

this works, I'm going to walk you through the full lifecycle of a request

sent to Claude. We are going to also take a brief look

at what is going on behind the scenes inside of Claude. To

get started with this walkthrough, we are going to consider a straightforward,

standard chatbot app. Let's imagine that you are

building a web app and want to show a chat window to a user

in the web browser. When the user enters a message

and clicks send, their expectation is that some

response will just magically appear. Now,

like I said, I want to examine what is going on behind the

scenes here to generate this text and display it on

the screen. We are going to break this down into five

separate steps, which I've outlined at the top of this

diagram. And we're going to walk through each step one by

one. When a user enters some text and clicks

send, that text is going to be sent off to a server

that you, the developer, implement. I mentioned

this step just to make one thing clear. You

should not attempt access Vertex directly from a web

or mobile app. Whenever you make a request of Vertex, you

are required to include secret credentials. And the best

way to make sure that these stay secret is by never including them

in your client-side app, and only making requests to Vertex

through a server that you implement and control. On

to step two. Once your server has received a request from

the client, the server will make a request to Vertex. Usually,

you will make this request through one of the SDKs that Anthropic

has published. There are official SDK implementations

for Python, TypeScript, Go, and Ruby.

To be clear, you are not required to use an Anthropic

SDK. You can also use one of the official Vertex

SDKs published by Google. When you make this request,

you are required to pass long several pieces of data. In

particular, you need to include the name of the model that you wish

to run, a list of messages, which will include the text

that your user submitted, and a max tokens

value, which limits the length of text that

Claude will actually generate. Next up

is the Claude model itself, which is where our text

will actually be generated. This is where we are going to go

into a little bit of detail on the text generation process

within the language model. This process is complex,

so I'm going to give you a simplified high-level overview.

We are going to break down the text generation process into

four separate stages. In the first stage, the

user's input will be broken down into smaller strings.

Each of these text chunks are referred to as a token.

These tokens can be whole words, or a part of word, or

even a space or a symbol. To keep things clear,

we are going to assume that each word forms one single

token. Each token is then converted into

an embedding. An embedding is a long list of numbers,

and you can think of these lists as being like a number-based

definition of a given word. Now, an interesting

aspect of written language is that a single word can

have many possible meanings, and it is only the word's

position in a sentence and presence of other words

around it that narrows the definition down to one particular

meaning. For example, quantum is a word

that has many different definitions, and when we see this

word, we don't really know what it means until

we see other words around it. Likewise, each

embedding can be thought of as containing all possible meanings

of each word. To refine each embedding down to a single

precise definition, a process known as contextualization

is used. In contextualization, each

embedding is adjusted based upon other embeddings

around it. This process helps highlight the meaning

of each embedding that makes the most sense given its

neighbors. The last step is generation, which is where

the text actually gets written. By this point, each

of the embeddings has absorbed a tremendous amount of information

from their neighbors. The final process embeddings are

then passed to an output layer, which produces probabilities

for each possible next word. Now, the

model doesn't automatically pick the highest probability.

Instead, it uses a mix of probability and randomness

to select words, which helps create more natural and

varied responses. The selected word is then

added onto the end of our list of embeddings, and the entire

process repeats itself all over. After generating

each output token, the model will then pause and ask

itself several questions to decide if it is done generating

text. First, it will count the number of tokens

it has generated and see if it is larger than the max

tokens parameter that was provided with the input request.

This max tokens parameter will limit the total number

of tokens that the model will generate. There is also

a special end of sequence token that the model can

generate. This is not a regular word. It

is a special signal that the model uses to indicate that it

has reached what it considers to be a natural end to

its generation and that it should stop. Once the generation

is complete, the API will send response back to your

server. The response will contain a message which

has the generated text inside it, along with usage

and stop reason. The usage is a count of the number

of tokens that you fed into the model and the number of tokens

that were generated. The stop reason will tell you

exactly why the model decided to stop generating

text, whether it hits a natural end of sequence token

or maybe it exceeded the allotted number of tokens.

Once your server has received this response, it will send

the generated text back to your web or mobile app,

where you will display it on the screen. So that is the entire

flow. Now, we covered many topics in

this video. I don't expect you to memorize any of this

just yet. The only goal is to start to get you familiar

with some common terminology around accessing Claude through

the API.
