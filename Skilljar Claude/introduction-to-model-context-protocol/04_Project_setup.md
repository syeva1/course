# Project setup

## Transcript

To better understand some aspects of MCP,

we are going to start to implement our own CLI-based

chatbot. This is going to give us a better idea of

how clients and servers actually work together. In

this video, I want to do a little bit of project setup and just help

you understand exactly what we're going to make. I've got

a lot of product description over here of what we're going to build.

We're going to go through all this over time. Right now, I just want

you to get a high-level understanding. So as I

mentioned, it's going to be a CLI-based chatbot.

We're going to allow users to work with a collection of documents.

These are going to be fake documents. They're just going to be stored in memory.

We're going to build out a small MCP client

that is going to connect to our own custom MCP

server. For right now, the server is going to have two

tools implemented inside of it. One tool to

read the contents of a document, and one tool to

update the contents of a document. Again, these

documents are here on the right-hand side. They're all fake, so

they are going to be persisted only in memory. That's it.

Now, before we go any further, there is a very

important note, something I really want you to understand

around this entire process. And that is that

on a normal project, typically we

would be implementing either a client or

an MCP server. So on a real project,

we might be authoring just an MCP server to

distribute to the world and allow developers to access some

service that we have built up. Alternatively, we might be building

a project where we make only a MCP

client. And the intent here would be that we would be connecting

to some outside MCP servers that

have already been implemented by some other engineers. So

in this project, we are making both a client and

a server. And we're just doing that in one project so

you get a better understanding of how this stuff actually works

together. All right, now that we have this disclaimer

out of the way, let's go through just a little bit of setup.

Attached to this video, you should find a file named

CLIproject.zip inside there is

some starter code for our project. Make sure you download

that zip file, extract it, and then open up your

code editor inside of that project directory.

Just to save a little bit of time, I have already done so. So

I've already got my code editor open inside of that small

project. Inside this project, I would encourage you to

take a look at the readme.md file. Inside

here, I've placed some setup directions. So it's going to walk you

through the process of making sure you put your API

key into the .emv file inside this project.

And it's also going to walk you through the process of installing dependencies, either

with uv or without uv. Once you

have gone through all this setup, you can then run the starter project

right away. To do so inside of your terminal,

make sure that you are inside of your project directory.

So I called my project MCP. And inside there,

I've got all my different project files and folders. To

run the project, we will run uv run main.py

if you're making use of uv. If you are

not making use of uv, then it'll be just python

main.py. Now I'm making use of

uv. So I'm going to do a uv run main.py.

And then when I run that, I should see a chat prompt

appear. And if I ask what's one plus one,

I should see a response rather quickly. That is it

for our setup. So now we can start to focus on adding

in some new features to this application.
