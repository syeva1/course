# Prompts in the client

## Transcript

Our last major task is to implement some functionality

inside of our MCP client and allow us to list

out all the different prompts that are defined inside the MCP

server and also get a particular prompt

with some variables interpolated into it. So

let's first implement list prompts. I will delete the

comment and replace it with a result is

await, self, session,

list prompts, and then I will return

result.prompts. And that's pretty much it.

And then get prompt. Now to be clear, when we get a

individual prompt, we're going to be given some number of arguments.

These arguments will eventually show up inside

of our prompt function. So for example, inside

a format document right here, we expect to receive a document

ID. Inside of this args

dictionary, the expectation is that there will be a document

ID key. And that will be passed in to

the appropriate function over here. And then we will get that

value interpolated into the prompt itself. So

inside the get prompt function, I will get a result

from self session, get

prompt. I'm going to pass in the prompt name. That's the

name of the prompt I want to retrieve. And then I'll pass in the

arguments. And then I will return result

.messages. So those are the messages coming

back. They form some kind of conversation that we want to

feed directly into Claude. And that's

it. That's all we have to do for our client. So

now we can test this out inside of the CLI itself. I'll

flip back over, run the project again. And

now if I put in a slash right here, I'll see that I

can access this format command. Now format

is really just the name of the prompt that we're going to invoke.

So if I select that and then hit space, I'll

then be asked to select one of the different documents and

you'll go with plan.md. I'll hit enter.

And then we're taking that entire prompt, really just

that single user message, and finiate directly

into Claude. So Claude now has the instructions

to go and reformat a document into Markdown syntax.

And it has also been given the ID of the document that

we want to reformat. So the first thing it needs to do here

is go and fetch that document's contents. And it

will do so by using the Git document tool.

And then finally, Claude is going to respond with the markdown

version of this document. So here is the document

with a bunch of markdown syntax inside of it. All

right, since it looked like this work just fine, let's do a

quick recap on prompts and make sure we understand what they are all

about. We begin by writing out an

evaluating a prompt that has some relevancy

to our MCP server's purpose. In our case,

we were making a document server. So having some functionality

or something about rewriting a document in a different

style, I think it kind of makes sense.

Once we have put our prompt together, we'll define a prompt

inside the MCP server. And then our client can

ask for that prompt at any point in time. When

we ask for the prompt, we will put in some number of arguments

that will be provided to this prompting function

right here as keyword arguments. And then our function

can make use of those keyword arguments inside the prompt itself.
