# JSON Schema for tools

## Transcript

Once we have created our tool function, we're going to move on to the

 next step, which is to

 write a JSON schema. This JSON schema is going to be used to describe

 our tool function, or more

 specifically, the arguments that the function expects to receive. Now

, the JSON schema is going

 to eventually be sent in our request off to Claude, and it's going to

 help Claude understand

 how to make use of the function we just wrote. Now, I know that when

 you look at all this

 configuration on the right hand side, it looks really intimidating.

 And this probably is one of

 the most challenging aspects in general of tool use, because this

 just looks like a huge blob of

 configuration that you have to write out. So let me give you a couple

 of notes here to help you

 understand what this is really doing for us. The first thing to

 understand is that JSON schema is

 not just specific to tool use or LLMs. In other words, this was not

 something that was just invented

 yesterday, just to facilitate tool use. JSON schema has been around

 for a very long time. It is a

 general purpose technique for data validation. There are two main

 areas to this big configuration

 object that I want to draw your attention to. At the top, there's the

 name and the description.

 We're going to come back to those in just a moment. For right now, I

 think the more confusing part

 is this JSON object right here. So I want to focus on this thing for

 just a little bit and make

 sure it's super clear how you put this thing together. The easiest

 way to understand this is to go

 through a example with a rather complex function. So let's imagine

 that we need to make one of these

 JSON schema specs for a function like this, process data. Now process

 data takes in four different

 arguments, ID is profile, primary ID and value. And based upon the

 example call, each one is going

 to take in a different type of data. So to turn this into a JSON

 schema that we can use back inside

 this larger structure, so basically whatever we want to put right

 here, here's exactly what we're

 going to do. I'm going to show you the simplest way of doing this.

 Step one, we're going to take

 our function and specifically the arguments. And we're going to write

 out a dictionary of all the

 keyword arguments with sample data for each one. So in this case,

 process data is going to take an

 ID's profile, primary ID and value. So I want to make a dictionary

 with exactly those keys. And I

 will provide some expected sample data for each of those different

 arguments. So IDs would presumably

 be listed numbers. I have a dictionary here, a string and a number.

 In step two, we're going to

 take that dictionary and convert it to JSON. Now I know it already

 looks like JSON, but there's one

 very important distinction. This is a capital T true, which is used

 in Python and JSON, it would

 be a lowercase T. So that's really the only conversion step you have

 to do, but it is important for

 the next step. So in step three, go off to Google, I'm not kidding

 here, go off to Google and search

 for JSON to JSON schema converter. There's a ton of different tools

 out there like this.

 These different tools allow you to paste in some JSON data. And based

 upon the values in that data,

 it will automatically generate a schema for you. So I'm going to

 paste in that dictionary that we

 just created and turned into JSON. Then I'm going to convert this

 thing. And now I've got exactly

 what I need to put into my tool schema. So this is the exact object I

 would want to use right here

 with one exception, we do not need that dollar sign schema statement.

 So I would delete that right

 there. Finally, step four, we're going to take that output, and we're

 going to add a description

 to each property. So inside of this properties object right here, I

've got a property of ID,

 primary ID, and the other two that I'm just not listing on this

 particular diagram.

 For each of these, I'm going to add in a description to describe

 exactly what this property or this

 argument into the function is supposed to do. So for example, if we

 go back to the example of the

 get weather spec that I had over here, you'll notice that the JSON

 schema, which is that section

 right there, the function get weather is expected to receive a

 location argument. It has to be a

 string. And then we provide a very descriptive or very detailed

 description of exactly what this

 argument does, and exactly how it fits into the overall tool use.

 When you are writing out these

 individual property descriptions, and the overall description for the

 tool itself, there's a couple

 of best practices that you really should follow. First, in the

 overall tool description at the very

 top, be sure to explain exactly what the tool does, when Claude

 should use it, and what kind of data

 it returns. We want our tool descriptions to be three to four

 sentences long, ideally. If you can't

 think of enough text to write out, remember, you can always just take

 your function. So for example,

 this right here, copy paste it directly into Claude, and ask it to

 write out a description for each

 the arguments to the function for you. Now, if you want to, go ahead

 and try to write out your own

 JSON schema for the get current date time function. If you don't want

 to put this together, that's

 totally fine. I've already written out a schema for you in the cell

 right above. So if you expand

 that one and scroll down a little bit, you will see that there is a

 get current date time schema.

 And if you want to take a look at it to get a better idea of how I

 structure this thing and the

 description of the overall tool, and some of the different arguments.

 All right, so that is our

 second step. We wrote out a JSON schema. So now the next thing we

 need to do is call Claude and

 include the schema with it. So Claude understands that this tool is

 available for use.
