# Prompt caching in action

## Transcript

Let's get our hands dirty with prompt caching

 and just write out a little bit of code to play around with it

 and understand how it works.

 I'm inside of a new notebook called 003_caching.

 I have a lot of the very same setup code

 that we've used several times before,

 but I've added in two new sections here.

 First, I've added in a cell with a rather long prompt.

 It's got about 6,000 tokens inside of it.

 I've also got a set of tool schemas.

 These are the same schemas we worked on earlier

 on inside the course.

 So I've got add duration to date time,

 the set reminder schema,

 and the get current date time schema as well.

 In total, all of those schemas put together

 are about 1,200 tokens.

 So both the prompt and the schemas,

 total up to definitely being above

 the minimum threshold for prompt caching,

 which again is 1,024.

 The first thing I wanna do to change this notebook

 is open up our helper functions.

 And I want to make a change to our chat function.

 In particular, I want to enable caching by default

 for our system prompt.

 So if we ever pass in a system prompt,

 I just wanna cache it no matter what,

 because again, we usually don't change

 the system prompt too often,

 and it's usually consistent between requests.

 And then for a similar reason,

 I always want to cache the list of tools as well,

 or specifically the tool schemas.

 And then finally, on our return statement down here,

 I want to include the usage field

 from the response object that we get back

 whenever we make our request.

 This usage object that we're going to include in here

 returns some information related to prompt caching.

 So we can use it to inspect and figure out

 whether or not we are successfully caching input

 that we're feeding into Claude or not.

 All right, so let's get to it.

 We'll start off first by making sure

 that we always cache our system prompt.

 So to do so, all we have to do is expand this list of parts,

 and we're going to add in a new part here,

 our cache point part.

 And that's going to have a type of default.

 And that's pretty much it for the first to do.

 So I'm going to mark that one as complete.

 Second, for caching our list of tools,

 I'm going to make a new variable here,

 tools with cache.

 And that's going to be our list of tools,

 and I'm going to concatenate in a new part

 of cache point type default.

 And then I'll make sure that I pass off tools with cache

 as our list of tools.

 So make sure we update that right there.

 Okay, that's all we have to do to enable caching

 for our tool list.

 And then finally down here at the bottom with my response,

 I'm going to add in a new usage.

 That'll be just this plain exact usage property

 from the response.

 So we're just going to essentially pass that right through.

 Okay, so that's really it for enabling prompt caching

 across a huge part of our application.

 So now both our system prompt and our list of tools

 are going to be cached.

 So I'm going to rerun that cell,

 and then we'll go down here to the bottom.

 And then after I get back a response,

 I'm going to print out the responses usage.

 Next up, I'm going to provide a system prompt right here.

 I'm going to use the prompt that I had included

 on that earlier cell, so code prompt.

 I want to include that as my system prompt.

 So I'll pass that in like so.

 And then I will put in a very simple text message here.

 So I'm just going to say something like

 summarize the design spec in one sentence.

 So the intent here is to just pretty much summarize

 everything that's inside of that giant code prompt.

 I don't really care about the text prompt here at all.

 All I really care about right now

 is demonstrating prompt caching to you.

 So again, I just really care about the usage field here.

 Okay, I'm going to run this,

 and I'm going to see something interesting.

 The usage field is going to have a cache read input tokens

 and a cache write input tokens.

 Because this is our very first request

 where we have never submitted

 this particular system message before,

 we are going to write some information to the cache.

 So Claude did a lot of work to analyze all the text

 inside this giant system prompt right here

 that we are providing, and then it stored the result

 of all that work into the cache,

 and it took up 6,322 tokens.

 So if we now make a followup request,

 within the next five minutes,

 my expectation would be that we're not going to see

 a cache write, and instead we're going to see a cache read,

 because now we're going to try to use all that work

 that we already did ahead of time

 in analyzing that system message.

 Okay, so I'm going to run this,

 and again, hopefully we're going to see a cache read,

 because we are consuming something out of the cache,

 and sure enough, there we go.

 And we're going to continue to see

 something from cache read right here,

 as long as we do not change our system message,

 so the content before our cache point,

 and as long as we don't go for a gap of five minutes,

 because as soon as we go over five minutes

 without making a request,

 that cache entry is going to be automatically cleared.

 So now the next thing I would like to do

 is just try changing our input text right here really quick.

 So I'm going to say, summarize the design spec

 in one sentence, period, it's only change I'm going to make.

 Now at this point in time, the system message

 occurs semantically above this text part right here.

 So even though I changed the text part,

 the cache point that we have for our system message

 is above this piece of text.

 So I should continue to see a cache read,

 even though I changed part of this user message,

 'cause I am reading the cache version

 of the system prompt, and there we go.

 Next up, if we go and change our system prompt in some way,

 so maybe I count this very first line right here,

 and just put a period at the end.

 Now I have a very different system prompt

 in the eyes of Claude.

 So if I run this, and then run the bottom cell again,

 now that I am feeding in different content

 for the system prompt, no more cache read.

 Instead, it turns into a cache right

 because that content has changed.

 If I run it again, now we're going to have a cache read

 because we cached the change version of that prompt.

 Now I know this is going really quickly,

 and I'm using a lot of terms here

 of in very quick succession, but I think if you personally

 play around with the caching system a little bit,

 you're going to get a sense of what's going on really quickly.

 Now the last thing I want to show you is caching tool use.

 So with the change we made to our chat function,

 all we really have to do is add in a list of tools,

 and remember we have some of those different schemas

 like add duration to date time schema.

 We have set reminder schema

 and get current date time schema.

 So once again, if we send this off,

 now we're going to see an even larger cache write

 because now we are caching both our schemas

 and the system prompt as well.

 All right, so that is prompt caching.

 Again, we are going to very often want to cache

 our system prompt and our tool schemas

 because they are very often going to be longer

 than that 1024 token cutoff.

 And by enabling prompt caching,

 we're going to pay less for our generation

 and the text generation is most often going to run

 a little bit faster.
