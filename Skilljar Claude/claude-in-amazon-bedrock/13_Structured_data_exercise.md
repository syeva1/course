# Structured data exercise

## Transcript

Let's go through a very quick exercise,

just make sure the idea of stop sequences

and message pre-filling are super clear.

So in this exercise,

I'd like you to write out the exact code

I've got right here on the screen.

All this code should be really familiar.

If you take a look at the prompt,

it says generate three different sample AWS CLI commands.

Now when you run this code,

you're probably gonna get back some output

that looks vaguely like this right here.

Just make it a little bit easier to read.

I rendered it as markdown down here.

So here's the sample starting output that I get.

You'll notice that it does give us three different sample

commands, but it has a lot of commentary around them.

So I've got a header and then some numbers

listing out each individual command.

For this exercise, I would like you to take this code

and using all new message pre-filling and stop sequences,

I want you to get all three different commands

in a single response,

all right next to each other

without any additional comments or explanation

or anything like that.

I don't like you to do this using only message pre-filling

and stop sequences.

So no adjusting this prompt at all.

So go ahead and give this a shot.

I did put a little hint on here, just as a reminder,

with message pre-filling, it's not limited

just to using characters like the Bactik, Bactik, Bactik.

You can put any kind of pre-filling response you want.

I would encourage you to pause this video now

and give this an exercise a shot.

Otherwise, I'll go over a solution right away.

So here we go. Here's how we're gonna solve this.

To solve this, the first thing I recommend you do

is take a look at the output

without any kind of pre-filling or stop sequences

or anything like that.

So if we take a look at what we have right here,

we'll notice that each of our three commands

are wrapped in a series of three Bactics.

So a good place to get started

would probably be to put in a pre-filled assistant message

of three Bactics to kind of tell Claude,

just go right into the command writing right away

and skip any initial commentary.

And then we might also decide to put in

a stop sequence of three Bactics as well.

Let's see how far that gets us.

So I'll put in a add assistant message

and I'll start everything off with three Bactics

and I'll put in a stop sequences

of closing three Bactics.

Let's run this and see how far it gets us.

My initial output looks kind of reasonable,

but it's not perfect just yet.

I do get three commands.

There's one, two, and three.

But you'll notice that I also get the word bash

added at the very start.

So where's that word coming from exactly?

Well, let me show you what Claude is really trying to do here.

We provided the initial assistant message

of those three Bactics.

Whenever you put down three Bactics,

it's kind of indicating that you are writing out some

Markdown and when you are writing a Markdown code block

with Bactics, you can optionally put in

a language identifier right here.

If you choose to put one in,

that whenever you render this as Markdown,

the content inside of those Bactics,

we rendered using that language's syntax highlighting.

So in this case, Claude decided to put in a bash right here

just to say, hey, we should use bash style syntax highlighting

when we render this stuff out.

Now for us, we don't want that at all.

So one way we could address this

would be to adjust our pre-filled message right here

and just include bash ourselves.

So that's now gonna make it super clear to Claude itself

that yes, you are inside of a Markdown code block

and inside this code block,

you should be writing out bash formatted commands.

So let me try run this again and see how I do now.

Okay, so that looks better.

Now I will tell you that from this point,

there are probably two additional errors

that you might want to address.

The first is sometimes you will get back a single command,

which is kind of an indication that Claude might want

to write out three separate Markdown code blocks.

The other problem that you might run into

because we are now using a bash code block,

Claude might try to insert some bash formatted comments

in there as well.

So it might be something like this command does xyz

and you might see that repeated.

And so we definitely don't want those comments

really just because that was one of the requirements

of this exercise.

So to get rid of those comments

and to also make sure that we get all three commands

more reliably, we can use that hint I gave you.

Remember the hint was message prefilling

isn't just limited to designating characters

like back ticks or stuff like that.

We can also use the message prefill

to dramatically guide Claude

in how it's going to answer us.

So in this case, we could add in something like

here are all three commands in a single block

without any comments.

And then I'll put in a colon right there

and then a new line.

Just so it starts all the Markdown stuff

on the next line down.

So I'm going to try running this

and we should now get some much more reliable output.

Okay, that looks good.

And of course I can keep running all day

and we're probably going to see exactly the result we want.

Okay, this looks good.
