# Enhancements with MCP servers

## Transcript

In this video, I want to show you one of the most interesting aspects

 of Claude Code.

 Claude Code has an MCP client embedded inside of it. That means we can

 connect MCP servers to

 Claude Code and dramatically expand its functionality. To demonstrate

 this, we are going to connect

 Claude Code to the MCP server that we have been working on. We just

 authored a tool called

 Document Path to Markdown. We can now expose this tool to Claude Code,

 allowing it to read the contents

 of PDF and Word documents. So we are dynamically expanding the

 capabilities of Claude Code.

 Let me show you how to set this up. Back inside of my terminal, I'm

 going to end my running session

 with a control C. I'm then going to add in an MCP server to Claude

 Code by executing Claude,

 MCP, add. Then we're going to put in the name for our MCP server. Now

 the name can be anything you

 want it to be. In our case, we are making a server related to

 documents. So I'm going to call our

 server documents. And then finally, we're going to put in the command

 that we use to start up our

 server, which for us is uv run main.py. So uv run main.py. And that's

 it. I'm going to execute that,

 and I'll start Claude Code back up with Claude. And now we can make use

 of that tool that we just

 put together. To really test it out inside of our test directory,

 there's a fixtures folder,

 inside there are two demo files, so a Word doc and a PDF doc. Both

 contain just a tiny bit of

 documentation around MCP itself. So I'm now going to ask Claude to

 convert the contents of either

 one of those files into Markdown. And my expectation is that Claude

 will make use of that tool that

 we just authored a moment ago. And if we scroll up just a little bit

 here, sure enough, it worked.

 So this actually is the contents of that file. This ability to

 consume MCP servers adds an

 incredible amount of flexibility to Claude Code, and really opens the

 door to some really interesting

 development opportunities. For example, you might decide to add in a

 series of MCP servers related

 to your particular development flow. For example, if you use Sentry

 for production monitoring,

 you can add a Sentry MCP server to allow Claude to fetch details

 about errors that are occurring

 in production. If you make use of Jira, you can add in an MCP server

 that will allow Claude to

 view the contents of specific tickets. If you're a Slack user, you

 can add Slack to message you

 whenever Claude is completed working on some particular problem.

 These are just a small fraction of the

 possible enhancements that you can add into Claude Code. So it would

 definitely be worth your time

 to think about how you can enhance your particular development

 workflow.
