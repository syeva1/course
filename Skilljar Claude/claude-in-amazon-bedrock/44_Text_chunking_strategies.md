# Text chunking strategies

## Transcript

Inside of this video and the next couple of videos,

 we're gonna start to implement our own custom rag workflow

 inside of a series of different notebooks.

 We're gonna first focus on just making

 the most simple basic rag setup we can possibly make,

 and then we're going to add in

 some additional steps over time.

 Now, as a reminder, a typical rag pipeline

 looks a little bit like this to really simplify things.

 We're gonna take a source document,

 break it up into chunks of text,

 then whenever user asks us a question,

 we're gonna find some relevant chunk of text,

 put it into a prompt,

 and that's pretty much the entire thing.

 So step one of this entire flow

 is to take a source document

 and break it up into chunks of text.

 Now, believe it or not,

 this process of taking a document

 and breaking it up into separate chunks

 is one of the more complex steps of the entire rag pipeline,

 simply because how we chunk our document up

 has a huge output on the quality of our rag pipeline.

 And I wanna give you an example right away

 to help you understand why that's the case.

 So take a look at this source document.

 It's just a couple of little lines,

 and it's supposed to kind of represent some kind of report

 from a company or something like that.

 And just reading through it really quickly,

 we can see there's really three general areas.

 We have a header,

 we have a section about medical research,

 and then a section about software engineering.

 Now, there are many ways

 in which we could divide this thing up into separate chunks,

 but I'm just gonna suggest one way.

 I'm gonna say for every kind of distinct line

 inside this document, we're gonna make a separate chunk.

 So we'd end up with about five separate chunks

 like the ones you see right here.

 If you consider each of these different chunks now,

 you'll notice something really interesting.

 The third chunk of text right here

 is all about medical research.

 That's what this text is about.

 It was inside of the medical research section,

 but it contains the word bug.

 So at kind of a high level,

 if you just glanced at this paragraph alone,

 it is almost like it's kind of about software engineering,

 just because it contains the word bug.

 And then likewise, down here,

 we have the software engineering section,

 and inside of it is the word infection vectors.

 Infection vectors is a little bit more of a medical term.

 So once again, we have a section

 that is about software engineering,

 but the language inside of it is kind of about medical research.

 So now we want you to think about what would happen

 if we took these chunks and we add them into our rag pipeline.

 Let's imagine that a user asked a question

 of something like how many bugs did engineers fix this year?

 So now our job as a part of the rag pipeline

 would be to find the chunks of texts we have

 that are most relevant for the user's question.

 Well, the user said something about bugs.

 So, well, at first glance,

 this chunk of text right here seems relevant,

 just because it contains the word bug.

 So we might decide to take this chunk of text

 and add it as context into the overall prompt.

 And as you can tell right away, this is a huge error.

 The user wants to understand something

 about software engineering from the report.

 So we definitely wanted this section,

 but we erroneously got something

 about medical research instead.

 So this is an example where a chunking strategy

 can easily introduce huge errors

 and very bad context inserts into your prompt.

 So to solve this problem, we're gonna spend a lot of time

 thinking about how we're going to take

 our original source document

 and break it up into different chunks of text.

 In this video, we're going to cover

 three different chunking strategies

 or methods to divide our document

 into separate chunks of text,

 each of which have some feature or some technique

 meant to address the problem that we just saw.

 So we are going to discuss size-based chunking,

 structure-based, and semantic-based.

 The first one we're going to cover is size-based chunking.

 This is where we take our big old document,

 so a big chunk of text,

 and we just divide it into a number of strings of equal length.

 This is by far the easiest technique to implement,

 and it's also probably the one you're gonna see

 most often in production implementations.

 So let's take a look at how size-based chunking is done.

 With size-based chunking,

 we're going to take our original document

 and divide it into some number of strings

 of more or less equal length.

 In our particular case,

 we have a source document with about 325 characters.

 So we could decide just completely arbitrarily

 to divide that into three separate chunks,

 and that means each chunk would have

 about 108 characters or so.

 So we might take the first 108 characters,

 put them in the chunk one,

 the next 108, put them in the chunk two,

 and just repeat for the entire document.

 Now, very simple technique,

 but right away, it has a big downside,

 and that is that each chunk is probably gonna end up

 with some number of cut-off words inside of it.

 You could see right away, the first chunk

 has the word significant cut-off.

 So it's just significant key in the first chunk,

 and then it ends the word in the next one.

 In addition, each chunk ends up lacking context.

 So for example, the third chunk down here,

 unfortunately does not really include the section header

 that was right above it,

 and this section header would have provided a lot of context

 on what this text right here is really talking about.

 So to solve this problem that starts to come up right away

 if you use size-based chunking,

 we can implement a overlap strategy.

 An overlap strategy is where we are still going

 to do size-based chunking,

 but we're also going to include a little bit

 of overlap from the neighboring chunks.

 So for example, we have the original chunk one right here,

 but we might decide to include just a number of characters

 from the next chunk down.

 So in this case, we might include the rest

 of the word significant plus the end of that entire sentence.

 So we would end up with a chunk that looks like this

 that just has a little bit more meaning to it.

 And then for chunk two, we would still have the body

 be this area right here,

 but we'd include an overlap of some number of characters

 from before the chunk and after the chunk.

 So with the strategy, we are going to end up

 with a decent amount of duplicated text.

 For example, in this case,

 we have section one medical research inside the second chunk,

 and that was also included inside the first one as well.

 So there is duplication of text,

 but the upside here is that each chunk of text

 has in general a little bit more context provided for it.

 The next kind of strategy that you're going to see

 is structure-based chunking.

 This is where we are going to divide up the text

 based upon the overall structure of our document.

 So we might try to find headers, or paragraphs,

 or general sections and use those as our dividing lines

 for each chunk.

 Implementing this strategy of chunking with our document

 would be really easy because our document

 is written with markdown syntax.

 We know that because it has the little pounds right here,

 the double hashes for each section.

 So we might look for these little pound symbols

 and then say that every time we see this kind of symbol,

 that means we must be starting a brand new section.

 So we could very easily write out some code

 to programmatically split on the double hash characters,

 and we would end up with some pretty well-formed sections,

 like what you see right here.

 Now this might sound like a fantastic strategy,

 but unfortunately, reality just doesn't favor it

 quite so often.

 In many cases, you are going to be trying to ingest documents

 that are not formatted with markdown syntax at all.

 They might be plain PDF documents that just contain plain text,

 in which case you will not get these very clearly

 delineated sections.

 So again, even though this seems like a great technique,

 implementing it can be really challenging,

 especially if you do not have any guarantees

 around the structure of your different documents.

 The last chunking strategy that we are going to discuss

 is semantic-based chunking.

 This is where you might take all of your text,

 divide it up into sentences or sections,

 and then use some kind of natural language processing technique

 to figure out how related each consecutive sentence is.

 You'll then build up your chunks out of groups

 of these somehow related sentences or sections.

 Now, as you can tell just by the description,

 this is by far definitely more advanced technique,

 so we're not going to look too closely

 into the actual implementation.

 The only reason I mention it at all is just to make it clear

 that there's really no set finite
