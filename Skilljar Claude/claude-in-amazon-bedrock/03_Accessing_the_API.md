# Accessing the API

## Transcript

In this module, we're going to understand how to access

Claude models through AWS Bedrock and use

them to generate some amount of text. To get started,

I want to walk you through a small example app, a

straightforward, standard chatbot application. So

let's imagine that you are making a web app and you want to show

a chat interface to a user, where a user can enter in

some message and then click on send. Whenever they do

so, their expectation is that some response

is going to just magically appear. But let's

examine what's going on behind the scenes to actually make this happen.

Whenever user submits some text, a request containing

that text is going to be made to your server. Your

server is then going to use the Bedrock client to make a request

to the AWS Bedrock service, where the Anthropic

models are actually hosted. In this request

made to the Bedrock service, we'll include something called a

user message, which contains the text the user submitted,

and a model ID, which specifies which model

we want to run. The chosen model

is going to run, it's going to generate some text, and it's going

to be sent back to your server inside of something

called an assistant message. Your

server can then take that generated text and send

it back down to the browser where it can be rendered on the screen

for the user to view. Now, in this section

of the course, we're going to be entirely focused on this communication

layer between this bedrock client and

the bedrock service. We're going to investigate how

to make API requests, how to access generated text,

and discover some common design patterns along

the way. Before we move on, I want

to clarify a common point of confusion, specifically

the difference between the bedrock API

and the Anthropic API. First,

a very quick review. Earlier on inside this course,

we discussed the Claude Sonnet and the Claude High-Q

models. These models are responsible for the actual

computational work that is done to generate some amount

of text. The Claude family of models

are currently hosted through two different services, AWS

Bedrock and the official Anthropic API.

If you're inside this course, you're going to be using the Claude

family models for the AWS Bedrock service.

Now here's the point you really need to be aware of. These

truly are different services. They're accessed

through different SDKs. They have different sources

of documentation. So whenever you are looking up documentation

or trying to understand how to use a model, just be

sure that you're looking at resources specifically for

AWS Bedrock. So now that we've cleared

up that point of confusion, let's move on to making our first

request to Bedrock in the next video.
