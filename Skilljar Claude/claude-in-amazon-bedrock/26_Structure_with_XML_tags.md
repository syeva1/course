# Structure with XML tags

## Transcript

The next topic we are going to examine is the idea of providing

 structure in your prompt

 by using XML tags.

 Now, let me give you a little bit of backstory on this.

 Very often, whenever we write out a prompt, we're going to interpol

ate some amount of

 content into it, and we've been doing that already.

 Inside of our example, we have been interpolating some height, weight

, goal, and restrictions.

 Now, each of these values are rather small, but it's entirely

 possible that we might

 eventually write a prompt where we need to put in a lot of content

 into a prompt.

 For example, examine the prompt on the right hand side.

 We might decide to paste in 20 pages of sales records and try to get

 Claude to analyze

 them in some way.

 Whenever we dump a lot of content into a prompt, it can be a little

 bit challenging for Claude

 to figure out exactly what text really means what or how text is

 actually grouped together.

 One way that we can make the structure of our prompt a little bit

 more obvious is by

 wrapping different pieces of content in XML tags.

 For example, I might provide a little bit more structure to this

 prompt on the right by wrapping

 the sales records right here with an XML tag of sales records, like

 so.

 Now there is no official XML tag called specifically sales records.

 This is a name of a tag that I just made up that will probably give

 Claude a little bit

 of insight into the nature of the content that exists inside these

 tags.

 I could have just as well called this records or perhaps even data.

 But of course, being a little bit more specific here is definitely

 better.

 So providing a tag of something like sales records would probably get

 us the best output.

 I want to make sure it's really clear why XML tags like this are

 necessary.

 So let me show you a little exaggerated example.

 In the prompt on the left hand side, I have a leading line of debug

 my code below using

 the provided documentation.

 So this kind of implies two things.

 It implies that underneath this header statement right here, I have

 some amount of code that

 was written by me that is buggy and some amount of documentation as

 well.

 And if you just look at the code that's listed out here, it's

 absolutely not very clear what

 content is the code and what content is the actual documentation.

 One way that we could clarify this to Claude would be to wrap each

 chunk of code with appropriate

 XML tags.

 For example, on the right hand side, I might wrap my code with some

 XML tags that simply

 say my code being very direct and obvious, and then the code that

 represents some amount

 of documentation in a docs tag, again, being very clear and obvious.

 Now it is much easier for Claude to understand what code it is trying

 to debug and which

 code provides some source of documentation.

 Let's take this idea of providing structure via XML tags and try to

 use it to improve

 our prompt that we are working on back inside of our notebook.

 Now unfortunately in this particular scenario, we don't really have a

 big blob of content

 that we really need to delineate in any way.

 All of our interpolated content, like the height, weight, goal, and

 restrictions are sufficiently

 short that Claude is probably not going to be confused by them in any

 way.

 Regardless, we can still use some XML tags to make it really clear

 that this is some kind

 of external input or maybe some information about the athlete that

 should be considered

 when generating the meal plan.

 So we might decide to wrap this entire block right here with some XML

 tags that just make

 it really clear that this is information about the athlete.

 So I might put in tags like athlete information and then a closing

 tag on the other side.

 Now let's try to measure and see whether or not this has any kind of

 impact on the quality

 of output.

 So I'm going to rerun the cell, I'll go down to my eval cell and run

 this one, and then

 you might recall that before adding in those XML tags, I had a score

 of 7.3.

 So let's see if we go up or down.

 And I end up going up quite a bit.

 Now you probably are not going to see an improvement quite this large

.

 As a reminder, I'm using a little bit more simple and basic model

 just so I get some exaggerated

 returns in these improvements to the prompt.

 So if you do not see quite a big a jump in quality, that is totally

 fine.
