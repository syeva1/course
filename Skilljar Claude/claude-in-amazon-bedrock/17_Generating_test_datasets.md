# Generating test datasets

## Transcript

Let's get started on building our own custom prompt evaluation

 workflow.

 We're going to be writing out a prompt and then writing out some code

 to evaluate how well it performs.

 So let's first focus on making a prompt.

 The goal of our prompt is to help users in writing out some code

 specific for AWS use cases.

 So we're going to allow user to enter in some kind of task that they

 need help with.

 And then we're going to respond with one of three types of output.

 We're either going to output Python, JSON configuration, or a raw

 just plain regular expression.

 Those are our three possible outputs.

 So we need to make sure that whenever a user asks for us to complete

 some kind of task,

 we give them some output in one of these three particular outputs

 without any other kind of explanation or header or footer or anything

 like that.

 So that's the overall goal.

 Now, the first step of our goal is, of course, to write out a draft

 prompt.

 Now, I've kind of already done that for us on the right hand side

 here.

 I've got V one of our prompt, where it just says, please provide a

 solution to the following task,

 and we'll put the user's task in there.

 Step two is to assemble a data set.

 Remember that a data set is going to contain some number of inputs

 that we're going to feed into our prompt.

 And then we're going to run our prompt for every combination of

 prompt and input.

 For our particular case, we're going to have an array of JSON objects

,

 where every object has a task property.

 These tasks are going to describe something that we want to be done

 by Claude.

 So we're going to take each of these tasks, put them into our prompt,

 and then feed the result into Claude.

 Remember that when we make a data set, we can either assemble it by

 hand,

 or we can generate it automatically with Claude.

 Now, as a side note, if you're using Claude for something like this,

 this would be a really good opportunity to use a faster model like Haiku.

iku.

 And that's what we're going to be doing here.

 Let's go back over to Jupiter.

 We're going to open up our notebook,

 and we're going to write out a little bit of code that's going to

 generate a sample data set,

 like the one you see on the left hand side, using Haiku.

 Okay, so back over here, I'm inside of a new notebook,

 and once again, very similar setup to all the others we have worked

 on.

 I'm creating a client.

 I have updated my model ID to use a inference profile

 that's referring to a Haiku series model, just so I get that

 additional speed.

 I've then got those three helper functions put together.

 I'm going to scroll down and make a new cell.

 And inside of here, I'm going to make a helper function called

 generate data set.

 And then inside, I'm going to write out a rather lengthy prompt

 that's going to ask Claude to generate this kind of evaluation test

 set for us.

 Just to save some time, I'm going to copy paste the completed prompt

 in here,

 rather than asking you to sit around and watch me type it out.

 Remember, if you want to just copy paste a prompt,

 you can always open up the completed version of this notebook

 and copy paste the prompt yourself as well.

 So I'm going to paste this thing in.

 So here's my prompt.

 You'll notice that I am asking it to generate some tasks related to

 AWS.

 And I'm giving it some example output here.

 And notice that the example output I'm asking for specifically an

 array of objects,

 each of which has a task.

 And then at the bottom, I'm also clarifying asking it to generate

 just three separate objects.

 So essentially three different tasks here.

 Remember that in a real world scenario, we would want to have way

 more than

 just three different test cases.

 But right now, this is enough.

 Do note that we are going to eventually come back and change the

 structure of this object.

 So for right now, it's going to be just a very plain, flat, simple

 object,

 but we will come back later and change it up a little bit.

 And the only reason I mentioned that is that if you go and look at

 the completed code,

 you might notice that this prompt looks a little bit different.

 All right.

 So now that we have this prompt put together at the bottom of the

 function,

 I'm going to make sure I indent because we are still inside of a

 function here.

 I'm then going to send this prompt off to Claude and ask it to

 generate some different tasks for us.

 So we'll add a user message.

 And then when we get our response back, we are expecting to receive

 some JSON.

 And to extract that JSON, we can use the same technique we covered in

 the last module,

 which is to use a combination of a pre-filled assistant module,

 or some assistant message, and a stop sequence.

 So we'll do a add assistant message.

 And I want to pre-fill message with Backtix 123 JSON.

 I'm going to call chat with messages.

 And I want to provide that stop sequence of three backticks as well.

 And now when we get this response back right here of text,

 this is really supposed to be some JSON.

 So I'm going to immediately try to parse that JSON using the JSON

 module

 and then return it from this function.

 So I will do a return JSON dot loads with text.

 I'm going to make sure that I imported that JSON module up here at

 the top.

 I did already.

 You might need to add in that import statement and rerun that cell.

 All right, then let's test this out really quickly.

 So back down here, I'm going to run that cell.

 And in the next down, I will call generate data set.

 And we'll see how we are doing.

 Because I'm using Haiku and I'm only generating three records,

 this should generate pretty quickly.

 And there we go.

 So it looks like these tasks are actually pretty reasonable.

 Once again, just reminding you that we would definitely want to have

 more than three here.

 And we would also want to have a lot more variety and kind of the

 structure of these requests.

 But again, for right now, this is definitely appropriate.

 I have a sample task to generate a Python function to write out a

 JSON schema

 and one regular expression as well.

 So this is overall looking pretty solid.

 The next thing I'm going to do is save this data set into a JSON file

,

 just so I don't have to constantly regenerate the data set.

 So I'm going to say data set, it's going to be the result of that

 generation.

 I'm then going to open up a file called data set dot JSON in right

 mode.

 And I'll do a JSON dot dump data set.

 And I'll format it really nicely just in case we ever want to open up

 that file

 and see what it looks like.

 So I'll write that file.

 It's going to take a moment just because I'm regenerating the data

 set again through Haiku.

 And that should be it.

 So now if I open up that data set dot JSON, here is my data.

 Okay, this is a good start.

 We've got our eval data set put together.
