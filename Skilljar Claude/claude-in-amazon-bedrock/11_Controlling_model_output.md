# Controlling model output

## Transcript

Besides just changing our prompts that we send into Claude,

 there are two other ways we could strongly influence the output that

 we get out of it.

 So in this video, we're going to discuss two techniques.

 One is pre-filling assistant messages, and second is stop sequences.

 Let's first take a look at pre-filling assistant messages.

 Okay, let's imagine that we send Claude some kind of really tough to

 answer question,

 something like is tea or coffee better at breakfast.

 I have absolutely no idea what kind of response Claude would give me.

 As a matter of fact, let's go over to our Jupyter notebook really

 quickly

 and see what kind of response we get in the first place.

 So back over here, I have created a new notebook,

 still has all the same code we had previously though,

 so I'm still making a client, assigning my model ID,

 and then I define those three helper functions.

 In the next cell down, I'm going to make a list of messages.

 I'm going to add in a user message of is coffee or tea better for

 breakfast.

 And then let's see what we get with that.

 So after a brief pause, we're going to get back probably a rather

 long message

 because I think Claude has a lot of input on this topic,

 but you can see right away that it's just not really taking a

 position per se.

 So there might be some scenarios where we want to strongly influence

 Claude one way or another,

 where we want to kind of direct its output or direct its response in

 some particular fashion.

 So one way we could do this is by pre-filling and assistant response.

 With message pre-filling, we're still going to assemble a list of

 messages.

 We're going to put our user prompt inside there,

 but there's going to be one extra little difference.

 You and I are going to manually put on an assistant message at the

 very end,

 and you and I are going to author the content inside of that

 assistant message.

 We're then going to take this list and send it into bedrock.

 And then in Claude, we can kind of imagine this is what goes on behind

 the scenes.

 We can imagine that Claude is going to see that first message and say

 to itself,

 "Okay, the user wants to know what I think about coffee versus tea."

 It's then going to take a look at the second message, which is an

 assistant message.

 And because it is an assistant message, Claude is going to say to

 itself,

 "Oh, it looks like I already have some thoughts on the situation."

 So I better continue my final response.

 I'm going to send back using this as a starter.

 So Claude is going to essentially use this as the start of its

 response.

 Because Claude sees the sentence, "Coffee is better because,"

 that's going to very strongly steer it in the direction of supporting

 coffee

 as being better at breakfast.

 So chances are, Claude is going to give us back a final assistant

 message

 that says something like, "It has higher caffeine,"

 which implies talking about coffee.

 Now, the one very important thing here to distinguish

 is that whenever we put in this final assistant message right here,

 Claude is going to assume that that is kind of content that has

 already been

 authored, and it's going to continue its response from the very end

 of the sentence.

 So you would kind of expect Claude to give you back a full response

 like this,

 where it says, "Coffee is better because it has a higher caffeine,"

 that is not the case.

 It's going to continue the response from the very end of whatever you

 pre-filled with.

 So in other words, this is not really a complete sentence.

 And if you want to use this, you're probably going to have to go back

 and kind of stitch together that text right there and that text right

 there.

 Okay. This is when you explain it, something is kind of hard to

 understand,

 but in practice, it ends up being really easy once you see a demo or

 two.

 So let's just go right out some more code and see how this actually

 works.

 So back over here, message pre-filling, super simple.

 All we have to do is say, "Add assistant message,"

 and we'll say, "Coffee is better because,"

 and now when we send this off, Claude is hopefully going to give us

 something that supports coffee much more strongly than it did

 previously.

 So before, it was kind of even on the fence.

 It said, "Oh yeah, either tea or coffee is fine,"

 but now with message pre-filling,

 we have very strongly steered it towards preferring coffee.

 And of course, we could say, "Tea is better because,"

 okay, that works.

 And then, of course, we could just give it a neutral position.

 And we could say, "They are the same because,"

 and then we get back the more neutral response that doesn't favor

 either of them.

 Now once again, I want you to notice that when we use this message

 pre-filling,

 we get back kind of a partial response right here.

 So it just says, "Both drinks don't have any nutrients."

 So like I mentioned, when we were looking at the diagram,

 it's kind of up to you to take whatever your pre-filled response

 right here was

 and join it onto the end of the actual response when you're using

 this technique.

 So now that we have seen message pre-filling,

 let's take a look at our other topic for this video,

 which is stop sequences.

 Stop sequences are going to force Claude to stop generating a

 response

 as soon as it generates some particular string that you provide.

 So let's imagine that we provide a prompt of count from 1 to 10.

 And naturally, our expectation would be that we get back 1, 2, 3, 4,

 5,

 all the way up to 10.

 We could stop the generation early by providing a stop sequence of

 the string 5.

 Then internally, whenever Claude generates the string 5,

 it's going to immediately stop the response

 and send whatever it has generated already back to us.

 Again, let's take a look at a quick example of this.

 Stop sequences are provided as an additional parameter to our con

verse function.

 So I'm going to scroll up a little bit, find where we define chat

 right here,

 because that's where we actually call it converse.

 I'm going to add in an additional optional keyword argument to the

 chat function itself.

 I'll call it stop, sequences, and I'll default it to be an empty list
.

 Then inside the inference config dictionary,

 I will pass in stop sequences like so.

 I'm then going to make sure that I rerun that cell.

 Now let's test this out.

 I'm going to go down to the very bottom of my notebook and make a new

 cell.

 I'm going to copy everything out of the previous one just to save a

 little bit of typing.

 I'll remove the pre-filled message and then update the user message

 to say

 count from 1 to 10.

 And if I run this as is, I'll expect to get back the full list of,

 well, 1 to 10.

 So if we wanted to truncate the response or stop it at a certain

 point,

 we could now add in to our chat function a stop sequences keyword

 argument.

 That's going to be a list.

 And inside there, we're going to put in all the different characters

 that we might want to stop at.

 They don't have to be individual characters.

 They could be full words.

 So I might say stop whenever you print out the character five.

 And if I now run this, we'll see only one, two, three, four.

 And you'll notice that it does not include the character five.

 So five is removed entirely.

 We can put in as many stop sequences as we want.

 So I could also put in say three, four, like so.

 And the response will just be stopped as soon as it sees any of these

 different sequences.
