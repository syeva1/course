# MCP review

## Transcript

We are all done with our project, but before we move on, I want to do

 a quick recap on the three server primitives that we learned about,

 so tools, resources, and props.

 In particular, I want to highlight something interesting about each

 of these, namely, what part of an app is really responsible for

 running each?

 In other words, in a typical application, who is really running each

 of these things and who benefits from them?

 Well, we would say that tools are model-controlled.

 This means that Claude alone is really responsible for deciding when

 to run a given tool.

 Resources are app-controlled, in other words, some code running

 inside of your app is going to decide that it needs some data

 provided by a resource.

 It will be your app's code that decides to execute a resource and use

 the return data in some way, maybe by using that data in the UI or

 something like that.

 In our case, we fetched a resource and then used that data inside the

 UI to provide a list of auto-complete options.

 We also fetched a resource to augment a prompt, both those things

 were really application-related code that was authored by you and I

 to put together.

 And finally, prompts are really user-controlled, so a user decides

 when a prompt is going to run.

 A user might start the invocation of a prompt by clicking on some UI

 element, like a button or a menu option, or they might make use of a

 slash command, which is what we did.

 The reason I highlight what is controlling each of these is to give

 you some idea of their purpose.

 So if you ever need to add capabilities to Claude, you're probably

 going to want to look at implementing some tools inside of your MCP

 server or consuming some server's tools through your MCP client.

 If you ever want to get some data into your app for the purposes of

 showing content in the UI or something similar, then you probably

 want to use a resource.

 And if you ever want to implement some kind of predefined workflow,

 you probably want to look at prompts.

 Now, you can see examples of all these ideas inside of the official

 Claude interface at Claude.ai.

 So here's what it currently looks like for me.

 You'll notice that underneath the main chat input are some buttons

 right here.

 If I click on one and then click on one of these examples, you'll see

 that I immediately dive into a chat.

 So this was a user controlled action. I, as the user, decided to

 start up this particular workflow and I'm making use of a prompt that

 was probably already written ahead of time and probably has been

 optimized in some way.

 So to implement that list of buttons right there, we would probably

 want to put together a series of different prompts inside of a MCP

 server.

 Likewise, if I go back and maybe click on this little tab right here,

 the plus button, you'll notice that I have a add from Google Drive

 button.

 Now, I'm not going to click on it because it's going to show some of

 my internal documents.

 But if I click on that button, I'm going to see some documents that I

 can add into this chat as some context knowing what documents to

 actually render in that list.

 And then whenever I click on one, automatically injecting its

 contents into the context of this chat, that is all application

 related code.

 So it is solely the application that needs to know the list of

 documents to render here. And that's, again, specifically UI related

 elements.

 So to implement that listing of documents from Google Drive, I would

 probably look at implementing a resource inside of a MCP server.

 And then finally, if I enter in a message to this chat of something

 like what is square root three, use JavaScript to calculate the value

 and send it off.

 I'm clearly expecting Claude to somehow execute some JavaScript code,

 which would likely be done through the use of a tool.

 In this case, the decision to use a tool was 100% model controlled.

 It is the model that decided to use some JavaScript tool execution.

 To implement something like this inside of a MCP server, we'd likely

 want to, you guessed it, provide a tool.

 So in total, that's our three different server primitives. And each

 one is really intended to be used by a different portion of your

 overall application.

 So we got tools which are generally going to serve your model,

 resources, which are generally going to serve your app and prompts,

 which are going to serve your users.

 And once again, these are high level guidelines.

 And the only reason I mention them is to just give you a sense of

 when you should use each of these primitives, depending upon what you

 are trying to put together.
