# Running tool functions

## Transcript

On to the next step where we are going to actually run a tool using a

tool use part that was sent back to us.

So in other words, when we get that initial response back that

contains a list of parts,

we're going to find all the different tool use parts based upon this

criteria right here.

We're going to run one of our different tool functions.

Now there is just one little gotcha here that I want you to be aware

of.

You see, whenever Claude decides to respond back to us and send back

a tool use part,

there is a potential that Claude might decide to use multiple tools

in parallel.

So we need to write our code to be a little bit defensive here

and assume that when Claude sends us back this tool use part, there

might be more than one.

So when we get that assistant message back, we might have a leading

text part

and then there might be maybe one or two or potentially even more

tool use parts in there as well.

So again, we just want to make sure we write code to handle this case

as well.

All right, let's go back over to our Jupyter notebook.

We're going to write out some code that's going to extract all these

different tool use parts

and then run the appropriate tool for each one.

Okay, so back over here, I'm going to make a new cell

and I'll write out a new function called run tools

and that's going to receive all the different parts that we get back

from a chat request.

So remember whenever we call chat now, we're going to get back text

and parts.

All we have to do is take parts right there and feed it into this

function.

Then inside this function, we're going to iterate over that parts

list

and find all the different tool use requests inside there.

So in other words, we want to extract this part and this part

and not extract the text part.

To do so, I will say tool request is going to be a comprehension

with part for part in parts if tool use in part.

So in other words, if the part object of that dictionary has the key

tool use inside of it,

that is a part that we care about.

So we are grabbing all the objects that have that key right there

specifically.

Then after that, I'm going to make a list that we're going to build

up over time.

Of all the different results, we'll use that in a little bit.

And then I will start to iterate over all these different tool

requests

for tool request in tool request.

I'm going to extract out the tool use ID, the name and the input to

send into the tool.

So I will get tool use ID from tool request tool use ID.

And to save a little time, I'm going to paste that down twice.

The next one, I'm going to extract out the tool name.

Then update the key on the right hand side.

It's not tool name. That's not the key that we need to extract.

So it's actually name. That's what the key is right there that we

need to get out.

So I will make sure I get name.

And then finally, the last one we care about is the input.

So the tool input and the key is simply input.

Now, just to make sure that we are going down the right path,

I'm going to add in a little print statement here really quickly.

So I'm going to print out. I need to run this given tool name with

these given arguments.

Then I'm going to test this by calling down here run tools with parts
.

.

I'll make sure I rerun the cell above to get a list of parts and then

test this out.

And I get, all right, I need to run the tool get current day time.

And here are the arguments I want to pass into it.

Well, that definitely looks good.

Next up, I'm going to make a helper function, which is going to be

responsible for actually running the tool.

So right above run tools, I'm going to make a separate function

called run tool.

This will take in the name, the tool to run and the arguments to it

as well.

And then inside of here, I'll put in a very simple series of if

statements,

many different ways we can do this, but we'll keep it simple.

I'll say if tool name is equal to our get current date time function.

So if that is the function that Claude wants to run, then I will

return get current date time.

And I will pass in tool input with star star tool input.

So little gotcha here, just something to be aware of,

you're always going to get back an object containing all the

different arguments that Claude wants to shove into your function.

So you're going to take that dictionary and you're going to splat it

in with star star into your tool function as I'm showing right here.

I'm going to also handle the case where Claude might mistakenly try

to ask for a tool that doesn't exist.

Now Claude is probably not going to make a mistake here.

It's actually much more likely that you are going to make a typo

somewhere.

For example, I might leave off the word time on here and put in just

get current date.

And this name needs to match up with our actual tool schema.

So entirely possible that we're going to make a typo ourselves.

And to handle that case, I'm just going to put in an else here.

So if I fall into the else case and I don't find the tool to run,

I will raise an exception with unknown tool name and then print out

the tool name and make sure that I make that a f string.

Okay, so now down here inside of our run tools function, I will

replace the print statement and I'll say tool output is run tool with

tool name and the input to it.

And now once again, let's try to run the cell.

We need to do a print first.

Let's make sure we actually see the output.

There we go.

So now run that.

And all right, that looks good.

So we got the current time right now in real life.

For me, it is 1224 roughly in fact.

So at this point, we have achieved this step right here.

We have written out some code to call a tool function.

So now we need to take the result of that function, whatever the

output was in our case, the current time.

And we need to send it back to Claude inside of something called a

tool result part.

So let me show you how we create these tool result parts.

Okay, the tool result part looks a little bit like the tool use parts

we looked at previously.

So these are dictionaries.

They're going to have a tool result key and inside a couple of

different properties.

The first is the tool use ID.

And I'm going to tell you about that in just a moment.

The second is content that's going to be simply the output that we

got from running our tool and we're going to serialize it as a string

just in case our tool function end up returning something like a list

or a dictionary.

So we're going to make sure we turn that into a string and put it

right there.

Then we're going to also provide a status flag of either success or

air.

Now it really is important to do air handling here because Claude is

rather intelligent when it comes to calling tools.

If Claude tries to call the tool and we end up returning an air to it

, Claude might try to figure out what's going wrong and maybe it'll

adjust the argument that it is providing and eventually figure out

how to correctly use your tool.

So we do want to make sure that we put in some reasonable air

handling here and add in that status of either success or air.

So now let me very briefly describe what this tool use ID is all

about because we saw this previously when we are looking at the tool

use parts.

So remember, these are kind of like our inputs, they had a tool use

ID and now the outputs, the tool results have an ID as well.

So here's what they are all about.

Remember what I told you at the start of this video.

Claude can potentially give us multiple tool use requests inside of a

single message.

So let's imagine a scenario in which we define a tool called

calculator.

Claude might decide that it needs to run that calculator twice in

parallel to execute two different operations.

Maybe one is evaluating 10 plus 10 and the second is 30 plus 30.

So when we receive these two tool use requests, we're going to

eventually have to send back to tool results.

And on this scenario, it would be kind of hard for Claude to figure

out which of these two results match up with the two original

requests.

And that's where the ID comes in.

So we need to make sure that the result of this operation of 10 plus

10, which might have an ID of 83,

has that same ID in the output as well with the appropriate output of

, in this case, 20.

And then the result of 30 plus 30 with an ID of P09 might be right

here, P09 with an output of 60.

So in short, the entire goal of this tool use ID key inside of here

is just to help Claude identify which result is which.

All right, let's go back over to our notebook and for every tool use

part we got,

we are going to generate one of these different tool request parts

that will eventually be sent back over to Claude.

Back inside of my notebook, I'm going to remove the print statement

and make a tool result part that will be a dictionary that has a tool

result key.

And inside of here, we will add in tool use ID content.

That will be a list with a dictionary in there with a text of JSON

dump string with the tool output.

00:09:03,000 --> 09:09:930
And I need to make sure I import JSON really quickly, which I will do

at the top of this cell.

And then finally, we need our status flag of success.

Now, this is assuming that everything always goes perfectly, but it's

entirely possible that one of our tool functions might fail in some

way.

So to really handle things
