# Rules of prompt caching

## Transcript

Now that we understand the theory, we are going to explore how prompt

caching with Claude actually works.

The core idea of prompt caching is identical to what we discussed in

the last video.

We will make an initial request off to Claude.

Claude is going to do some processing on that initial message,

and then Claude is going to save all that work into a temporary cache.

Then if we make a follow-up request at some future point in time,

and include the identical exact same message, rather than processing

that message all over again,

Claude is going to instead look into the cache, find the work that it

had already saved,

and load it up. Just to be clear, the work that we saved the cache

does not persist forever.

It is only stored there for five minutes. You're going to find prompt

caching is most useful

anytime that you are repeatedly sending the same content over to

Claude again and again and again,

because it really is this kind of two-phase process. We have to make

that initial request

to write some data into the cache, and then only the follow-up

requests are going to be able to

take advantage of that work that was done ahead of time. To enable

and control prompt caching,

we are going to make use of a new type of message part called a cache

point.

So by default, there is no prompt caching enabled with Claude. We have

to add in these additional

new types of parts into our different messages. You might recall that

we have other types of

parts we've already discussed, like a text part and an image part and

so on. So this is just yet

another type of message part that we're going to need to understand.

When we include a cache

point inside of a message, we are telling Claude that we want to cache

all the work that is done

for all the text up to that point inside of our message. Now that's

really confusing to hear in

just plain words. So let me as usual show you a quick diagram here.

All right, so let's imagine

we have an initial request we send off to Claude. We have a text part,

then a cache point, and then

another text part. As usual, because this is an initial request,

Claude is going to go through

some amount of work that is done to process the first text part and

the second text part.

And we're going to visualize that with this box right here and this

box right here. Because

we put the cache point in between these two parts, everything before

this cache point is going to be

cached. So in other words, this work right here, it's going to be

cached. But everything after the

cache point, in other words, this right here is not going to be

stored in cache. If we then make a

follow up request where that initial text part is identical to the

one we had sent previously.

So here's that same exact text part right here that is above the

cache point, rather than trying

to process that chunk of text again, Claude is going to see if it

already has something stored

inside the cache. In this case, it does. So it's going to reuse this

bit right here.

Claude is not going to look into the cache to see if it has already

processed these other

text parts previously, because they are all listed after this cache

point. Now a key point to understand

here is that the caching system is only going to work if everything

before the cache point is

identical. So in this case, before the cache point, I have one text

part that says exactly

summarize this long text and then whatever text we want to summarize.

If we instead made a follow

up request, where the text part was slightly different, if it said

something like, please

summarize this long text. Well, this text part is now different. So

Claude would not attempt to use

this cached work that it had previously generated. Instead, Claude is

going to ignore the cache

and generate a new analysis or go through all the work once again on

this brand new text part

that it has not seen previously. The next thing to understand is that

cache points are not limited

to just one single message or one single text part. They can use to

store work that is done on

multiple different messages, multiple different parts, even assistant

messages. For example,

if we make an initial request like the one you see right here, where

we have our cache

point all the way down here at the bottom, Claude is going to process

all the different

text parts across all the messages before it. We're going to get some

intermediate work like

what you see. And then Claude is going to cache all that over here.

Then if we make another follow

up message with the exact same text parts across all the different

user message, assistant message,

user message, we're going to reuse this cache. So here's our follow

request. Again, we have

everything identical before the cache point. We're going to reuse all

that work we had done

ahead of time. Before we move on, there are two other very quick

ideas I want to share with you

around prompt caching. First, there is a minimum amount of content

required for Claude to cache

its work. There must be at least 1024 tokens worth of content before

a cache point in order for Claude

to actually cache its work. So in the first example up here, the only

content we have before the

cache point is a single text message of Haiku. That is definitely

not 1024 tokens long.

So in this case, that we are not going to write anything to cache.

But down here, if I've got

Haiku, Haiku, Haiku repeated 500 times or so, that is

probably going to be

greater than 1024 tokens worth of content. So all the different text

parts right here,

the result of processing all them is going to be cached, and we can

make use of that cache on

follow-up requests. The other big item that I want you to be aware of

around prompt caching

is that we are not limited to just caching message parts. We can also

put in cache points on tool

definition lists, so the actual list of schemas we pass in, and we

can also provide cache points

on system prompts as well. So for example, when we pass in a list of

tools, the actual tool specs

where we write out all that JSON can end up being rather long, and

they count towards our token

budget for any given request. So when we pass in our list of tools,

we might put in all of our

different JSON schema specs, and then a cache point right after it.

The same thing can be done

for a system message as well. We can pass in a text part that

includes the actual system prompt

that we want to cache, and then right after that a cache point. Now

even though I'm tossing this idea

of caching the tool schemas and system prompts towards the end of

this video, this actually ends

up being one of the more common locations where you are going to

implement prompt caching. Because

in reality, it's rather rare that we are going to change our list of

tools or even the system prompt

between requests. So because we are going to very often make the same

request with the same exact

list of tools and system prompt, you're very often going to want to

put in cache points.

All right, so now that we understand all this theory around prompt

caching, it's time to actually

get our hands dirty by writing out some code. Let's come back in the

next video and test out

prompt caching inside of a Jupyter notebook.
