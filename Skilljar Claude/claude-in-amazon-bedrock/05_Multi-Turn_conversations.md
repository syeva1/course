# Multi-Turn conversations

## Transcript

The code that we've written out so far simulates a very simple exchange

with our model. And we can kind of visualize this conversation

inside of a chat box like this. So we sent

in a request asking in something like, what's 1 plus

1? We got a very simple response back. Something like

the answer is 2. Naturally, we might

want to continue this conversation at some point in time.

So we might want to send in a follow-up asking something

like, and three more. And then we would expect

to get back a response, saying something like adding three to two

would result in five. To have a multi-message

conversation like this, there's something really critical you need

to understand around the Bedrock API and Claude

itself. And that is that Betterock and Claude do

not store any messages. None of the messages

you send to it get stored in any way, and none of the

responses you get back are stored in any way.

So if you ever want to have some kind of conversation going

on, where you have multiple messages that kind of maintain a

context or a flow, then there are two things you

need to do. You need to manually, inside of

your code, maintain a list of all the messages that

you are exchanging. And second, you need to make

sure that you provide that entire list of messages with

every follow-up request that you make. So let's

go into some detail on this entire idea just so it's really

clear that you understand what's going on here. The first

thing I want to do is run just a little bit of sample code. So

I've still got the code we wrote in the last video up here where we asked what's

1 plus 1, and we got back the 1 plus

1 is 2. Now I'm going to paste in Some

additional code snippet here that I wrote ahead of time. So

in this additional code snippet that I just pasted in, I'm making another

call to Bedrock, and this time I'm providing

a message of just and three more. So this kind of simulates

that screenshot I showed you a moment ago. And now if

I run this cell, I will eventually get back

a response that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

So let me show you a diagram to make sure it's clear why we got

this very strange text. OK. So

on the left hand side, I've got the messages that I'm including in

my request off to Bedrock. I start off with just

a message of what's 1 plus 1. We send that in and we

get back an assistant message of 1 plus 1 is 2,

exactly what we expect. When I then execute

the code that you saw just a moment ago, that extra little code snippet, I

sent in a request that contained just one single message

that said, and three more. Now, when

we send this and three more in, Claude is going

to do its best to give you a response. In our

case, the response we actually got back didn't make a lot of sense, but it's

doing the best job it possibly can, because all

it knows is the fact that we said, and three more.

So to solve this problem, here's what we're going to do. As

I mentioned just a moment ago, we're going to manually maintain a list

of these messages and make sure we provide that list

with every single follow-up request. So

as demonstration of what we're going to do going forward, whenever we want to

have a multi-turn conversation, we're

still going to send in this original user message.

We're going to get back the assistant response, and then we're

going to include that assistant message in

our list of messages. So we're going to kind of move it on over there

to the left-hand side. Then whenever we want to continue

this conversation, we're going to append onto the end

of the list another user message, where we ask,

and three more. And now when we take this full

list of messages and make our request, Claude will have the

full context of the conversation. It will see all

three messages, and we'll know exactly what we are talking about

when we say, and three more. So we'll

get back, hopefully, response is something like 3 plus 2

is 5. Let's go back over to our notebook

and try to simulate a multi-turn conversation

like this. Okay, so back

over here, I'm gonna delete that little code snippet I paste

in very quickly. Then inside this earlier

code cell, I'm gonna write out three helper functions.

These helper functions are just gonna make it a little bit easier for us to maintain

the entire context of this conversation and maintain

that list of messages. So right above user

message, I'm going to put in a function definition of add

user message. I'm going to assume that I'm going

to call this function with a list of messages and

some text. I'm going to indent user

message like so. I'm going to replace

what's one plus one right here with the text

argument that we're going to pass in. And

then right after we define user message, I'm going to add

that into the list of messages. Next

up, I'm going to copy this function entirely. I'm

going to paste it right down here. I

will rename it to add assistant

message. I will change the

name of this variable to be assistant message, change

the role to be assistant,

and then finally update messages dot append right here to be

assistant message instead. So

now we have two helper functions that can very easily make

a message type for us, either a user or an assistant message

and append it into an existing list of messages.

Then one more helper function. Down here,

I'm going to make it just a little bit easier for us to call

our model, get a response, and then get the actual text we

care about out of it. So I'm going to also

define a function right here called

chat. It will take in a list of messages.

I'm going to indent response. I'm

going to pass in the list messages like so.

And I'm going to return from this function, response,

output, message. And

do you remember everything you have to put in there? It's then content.

That's right. We then get a zero and text

like so. So now with these three

functions, we can very easily simulate a full conversation.

Let me show you how we would do it. Down here in this cell, I'm

going to paste in a couple of comments that I wrote ahead of time

just to guide myself and make sure I'm doing this entire conversation

correctly. So here's my list of comments. We're going to put

in one line of code for each comment that I've added in. But

don't worry, each line of code is me very short and simple.

First, I'm going to make a starting list of messages. So initially,

I start off with no communication whatsoever. I'm

then going to add in the initial user question, so that

initial user message of what's one plus one.

To do so, I'll call add user message, pass

the list of messages, and then the second argument is going to

be the actual text I want inside this message. So

in this case, it'll be what's one plus one.

And then immediately after that, I'm just going to print out messages really quickly

to make sure that we are on track. So I'm going to run this.

And it looks like, yep, we added in our user message

correctly. So I've got the role of user, content

as a list, and a Python dictionary inside there. So

I'm going to continue on to the next step. I'm

going to pass the list of messages into that chat function

we made to get back an answer. So when we call

that chat function, it's going to reach out to Bedrock and call our

API. So we'll say answer is

chat and pass on the list of messages. And

once again, just to make sure I'm on track, I'll print out answer.

I'm gonna run that. And after our short pause, I see, yep,

we got it correctly. We got our answer of one plus one equals

two. So now we have this answer back as

a plain string. We need to take that and

add it as an assistant message into our

list. And again, we're gonna do so by using that helper

function we just made. So we'll say add assistant

message pass in our list with

the answer we just got back. And once again, printout

messages just make sure we're doing this correctly. So

now we will see, yes, we are in fact building up our

conversation. We're building up our list of messages. We've

got first user and then assistant. We got what's one

plus one and then the answer we got back. So

now we can follow up with

the user's additional question, which was add

user message. and we'll

say, and three more added

to that. And

we'll skip checking messages again. Let's go ahead and get our follow-up

answer by

calling our API again with a full list of messages.

I'll print out the final answer and let's see what we end up with.

And so sure enough, starting with the result of that, and

we add three more, we end up getting five. So

now it's very clear that we are maintaining the context of

this conversation by including all the previous

messages inside of our follow up request. Now,

this might initially seem a little bit tedious, and

even this code right here might seem a little bit confusing. I

don't blame you if it is confusing. Don't worry, this is the

kind of thing that you're going to get really used to very

quickly. And there's just one last thing I

want to mention around lists of messages, like

the one we have assembled right here. And that is, whenever

we send in a list of messages to the API, we

always need to make sure that we are alternating roles

between each message. So in other words, we should always

have a user and then an assistant, and

then a user, and then an assistant. We should never

have two user messages in a row, and we should also never

have two assistant messages in a row, or any

variation thereof. So we always want to make sure that we are varying

or alternating those roles.
