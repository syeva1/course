# Multi-Turn conversations with tools

## Transcript

The next thing I want to show you is how to have a long running

 conversation that includes tool use you'll notice that I collapsed

 the cell that has our run tools implementation just make things a

 little bit easier to read.

 Now as we saw at the end of last video right now everything works

 just fine, but I want you to notice what happens if I change the

 original query right here and if I instead say something like what is

 one plus one.

 So if I run that I will get back it responds really quickly. I'll

 then add in the result of running tools to messages and print out

 messages and let's see what happens.

 So in this scenario we got back a response from the assistant that

 did not include any tool use requests. So we kind of erroneously

 added in this completely empty message right here.

 In order to have a long running conversation that includes tools what

 we should really do is take a look at the stop reason that comes back

 inside response.

 Remember whenever we get a response back from Claude it's going to

 include a stop reason we should really consider the stop reason in

 deciding whether or not we need to process any tool use requests.

 So let's do a little refactor here back inside of my notebook. I'm

 going to first do a little bit of code cleanup. I'm going to find the

 example conversation we had right here. I'm going to delete that cell

.

 I'm going to delete this example one right here and this one right

 here.

 Next up I'm going to go up to the very top where we have our helper

 functions defined inside of here we can find the chat function.

 Now remember we did refactor here just a little bit ago to always

 return text in parts but now I also want to return the stop reason.

 We could add in another multiple return element right here so I could

 just put in stop reason if we wanted to but that's starting to get a

 little bit challenging to work with.

 So I'm going to change the return structure of this chat function

 just a little bit.

 First I'm going to delete text right there. I'm still going to keep

 parts and now I'm going to return a dictionary that is going to have

 the list of parts.

 I'm going to return a stop reason which will come from response stop

 reason with a capital R and then I will still return text and I'm

 going to do a little fix here on text at the same time.

 You see what we had previously we always tried to access the first

 part of a message and we always assumed it was a text part.

 That's not necessarily always going to be true. So to fix things up

 just a little bit I'm going to scan through the list of parts.

 I'm going to find all the text parts and just join all the text

 together.

 So I'll put in a new line and I'm going to join on a comprehension

 with P text for P in parts if text in P like so.

 All right so now we are getting a list of parts we got the text and

 our stop reason.

 We could at this point kind of just return the entire response object

 but doing this pre processing just kind of a nice little thing to add

 in.

 Now I'm going to rerun that cell and now let me show you how we are

 going to use that improved chat function.

 I'm going to add a new code block here at the bottom and inside of

 here we are going to make a new function that's going to handle a

 multi turn conversation for us that involves tool use.

 So I'm going to make a new function called run conversation.

 It's going to take in a list of messages and inside of here I'll do a

 while true and I'll say result will come from calling chat with the

 list of messages and my list of tools.

 Right now we only have one tool schema which is get current date time

 schema.

 Then I'm going to add assistant message to messages with result parts

.

 So that's where we are taking all those tool use parts and

 potentially text parts and adding them into our message history as an

 assistant message.

 I'm then going to print out whatever result text we got back just so

 we can kind of monitor the conversation.

 If the results stop reason is not equal to tool use.

 Then I'm going to break out of the while loop.

 So in other words if we're not asking for a tool that means we must

 have hit some other reason to stop the conversation and we don't need

 to continue inside this while loop anymore.

 Otherwise if we continue that means that we must have a need to run

 some tools.

 So I'm going to get my tool result parts by calling run tools and

 pass in those parts and add that as a user message to messages.

 And that's it. So now whenever we run this function we'll pass in a

 list of messages. We're going to get back a result.

 If we have need of calling any tools we will do so and continue

 inside of the while loop again until we finally get a response back

 that does not ask us to do any kind of tool use.

 At the very bottom here outside of the while loop I will return

 messages.

 So I'm going to run this and let's do a test down here.

 I'll ask what we need to make our list of messages first my mistake.

 I'll add a user message of what time is it and call run conversation

 with the messages.

 So now let's test this and see how we're doing and we should see the

 conversation kind of progress as Claude figures out what is going on.

 Okay so there we go we've got first I can help you figure out the

 current time let me use a tool to figure out the current time for you

.

 I then get the current time and then I see my entire log of messages

 right here and you can absolutely go through this and just verify

 that we have the correct ordering of messages.

 We've got our original user we've got the tool use request we've got

 the tool result being sent back to Claude and then a final assistant

 message coming back that does not ask for any tools.

 So the nice thing about this approach is it should very easily also

 support questions that don't require required tool use at all.

 So if I ask what is one plus one we should just about immediately see

 a response back and yes there we go.

 Alright so this is excellent the last thing we really have to do to

 finish up this section is go through adding in multiple tools because

 right now we just have one just adds in the current time not super

 useful so we're going to add in those last little pieces in just a

 moment.
