# Tool functions

## Transcript

To learn more about tools, we are going to set ourselves a little

 goal.

 This is going to be a small project that we implement inside of a Jup

yter Notebook.

 We are going to try to teach Claude how to set reminders that occur

 at some point in time in the future.

 This is going to require us to implement several different tools.

 And for right now, we're just going to focus on one tool at a time,

 but just know that we're going to eventually have to deal with

 multiple tools.

 So I want to eventually be able to send a message to Claude of

 something like

 "set a reminder for my doctor's appointment, it's a week from

 Thursday."

 And I want Claude to respond to something like,

 "Okay, I will remind you at that point in time."

 When you first look at this task, you might think it seems really

 easy,

 but it turns out that there are actually several different challenges

 that we're going to need to tackle, and we're going to solve all of

 them through the use of tools.

 So in particular, Claude does know the current date.

 In other words, if you open up a prompt right now, you could ask it

 what the current date is,

 and it will give you an exactly correct answer.

 However, Claude doesn't always know the exact time of day.

 So if we were to ask Claude to do something like,

 "set a reminder for 24 hours from now, expecting it to be exactly 24

 hours,"

 Claude doesn't really know what 24 hours from now actually is because

 it doesn't know the current time.

 Secondly, Claude does not always perfectly handle time-based addition

.

 So if I were to ask it, what is 379 days from January 13th, 1973,

 Claude will very often give you the correct answer, but sometimes it

 will get that addition incorrect.

 And finally, Claude just doesn't know what it means to set a reminder

.

 It has no concept of it.

 It does know conceptually what setting a reminder is,

 but there's no mechanism inside of Claude whatsoever for setting

 reminders in the future.

 To solve each of these issues, we are going to make a dedicated tool.

 So we have three issues right here.

 We are going to make three separate tools, one at a time.

 Here's what each tool is going to do.

 We're going to have a very simple tool that we're going to get

 started with.

 Its only job is to get the current date time.

 So that means the current date plus the time.

 The second tool we will make will add a duration to a date time.

 So this will allow us to say something like,

 take the current date and add 20 days to it and what would the

 resulting day be.

 And then finally, we will make a reminder setting tool as well.

 And then finally, we will make a reminder setting tool as well.

 The first tool that we are going to create and test is the get

 current date time tool.

 There are several different steps that go into making one of these

 tools

 and I've listed them all out at the very top of this diagram.

 So one step one right now, writing out a tool function.

 If we go back over to this diagram we had looked at previously.

 We are currently in this step over here where we are going to write

 out a function

 that will eventually be called on our server at some point in time.

 So for these tool functions, we're going to write out a plain Python

 function

 and it will be called automatically at some point in time.

 There are several best practices around these functions

 that we will go into very shortly.

 But for right now, let's go over to our Jupyter notebook

 and get started on this get current date time function.

 And again, it's going to be really easy for us to put together.

 All right, so back over here.

 I am inside of a new notebook and I've called it 001 tools.

 It has a lot of very familiar code.

 I would really recommend you download this copy or that kind of the

 starter version

 of this notebook regardless because I have added in a rather long

 function down here

 just to save us a whole lot of time.

 It's called add duration to date.

 This is going to be one of our critical functions later on.

 But as you can see, it has a lot of code for it.

 So I did not want you to have to write it all out yourself.

 So make sure you download this kind of starter version of the

 notebook.

 I'm going to add in a new cell and we are going to immediately start

 to implement our tool function.

 So this is a function that will be called automatically at some point

 in time.

 I'm going to call it get current date time.

 I'm going to take in an argument of date format

 and I will give this a default value of percent capital Y percent

 lowercase M percent D.

 And then just a little bit more percent capital H percent capital M

 percent capital S.

 Then inside of here, I'm going to return date time dot now SDRF time.

 And I will put in that date format string.

 I'm then going to test this out very quickly by calling it current

 date time.

 And sure enough, there we go.

 There is my date time.

 Whenever we write out these tool functions, there are a couple of

 best practices.

 I really recommend you follow first off and by far the most important

.

 I really recommend you use well named and descriptive arguments.

 You're going to see later on that this step is really important.

 Secondly, if possible, validate the inputs that are passed into the

 function

 and raise an error if they fail validation.

 So in the case of this get weather example on the right hand side,

 if we get a empty location, so just an empty string,

 well, that's probably a mistake.

 We can't really get weather for a unknown location.

 So we might want to immediately raise an error and just say,

 sorry, but the location can't be empty in our particular case

 with the get current date time function.

 We could just validate the date format input to make sure that it is

 a string.

 But beyond that, technically we could put in any string here

 and everything is going to work out OK.

 And there are scenarios where you would want to allow strings like

 this.

 So I would be a little bit hesitant to try to strictly validate the

 input string

 in this particular case.

 Well, we've got our first tool function put together.

 Let's come back in just a moment and understand how to write out

 a JSON schema spec to describe this tool function.
