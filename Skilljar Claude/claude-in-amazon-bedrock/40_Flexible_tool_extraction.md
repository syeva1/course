# Flexible tool extraction

## Transcript

Without a doubt, the number one downside to making use of tools for

 structured data extraction

 is having to write and manage these really big JSON schemas. So in

 this video, I'm going to show

 you a little trick to alleviate that pain. So here's what we're going

 to do. We are going to make one

 single schema with a name of something like to JSON. And then we

 will tell Claude that the inputs

 to it is going to be an object that has as many properties as Claude

 wants to add. Then inside

 of our prompt, we will write out the actual structure that we want.

 So the actual listing of different

 properties that we expect and the different types. And then we will

 tell Claude to call this tool

 and pass in some argument that follows the structure that we listed

 out in our prompt. Now yet again,

 this is another scenario we're taking a look at an example is the

 easiest way to understand what's

 going on. So let's go through a quick example. All right, so back

 over here, I want to again

 scroll up a little bit and find that section with tool schemas.

 Inside of here is the article

 detail schema, which we already used. And if you scroll down, you

 will find to JSON schema, which

 has all the same properties and description as what you just saw in

 that diagram a moment to go.

 So we're going to make use of this schema as a flexible way of

 getting any kind of structure of

 data out of Claude. All right, so I will once again go down to the

 very bottom of the file and we're

 going to start in a brand new cell. I will then make my list of

 messages, add a user message.

 And to save time as usual, I'm going to do a little bit of copy past

ing from the cell above.

 So I'll go just right here and take that F string, go back down and

 put it right there.

 I'm then going to update the prompt to tell Claude to call the to

 JSON tool. And then underneath

 article text, I'm going to be very clear with Claude and tell it

 exactly how to call that tool.

 So I'll say something to the effect of when you call to JSON, pass in

 the following structure.

 And then I will list out all the different properties that we need.

 Now notice we are in

 an F string here, so we need to use escape curly braces, which means

 we just need to double them up.

 And then I will list out the title. And I'll put in a little comment

 here. So I'll say it should

 be a string. And this is going to be the title of the article. I'll

 copy that

 and replace with author. And then topics will be a list of strings

 and say a list of topics

 mentioned in the article. Okay, so there is our user message.

 So now we are going to call Claude, we will get some flexible result.

 Just to distinguish from our earlier result variables, we declared

 early inside of this file.

 We'll call chat, pass in our messages. And then we do need to provide

 our list of tools. Don't

 forget about that. So we want to use our to JSON schema. And we want

 to force a tool use here.

 So we'll pass in a tool choice. And we want to use the tool that is

 named to JSON.

 All right, let's run this and see how we do.

 So I'll print out flexible results. And now once again, there's our

 results. So we've got our input

 with a title, author, and then our list of topics. And so you can see

 right away that life is a lot

 easier when we are making use of this style of tool based extraction,

 because now if we need to

 change the structure of data coming out, all we have to do is make a

 very simple edit inside of

 this prompt. So if I also want to get maybe the number topics about

 just numb topics,

 let's make that an integer and say number of topics mentioned. And

 that's all we have to do.

 So I'd rerun that. Once it's done, we can print out flexible results

 again. And now we should see

 number of topics listed as well. All right, so again, this is a much,

 much more easy way of

 specifying the exact structure of the data that you want when you're

 making use of tool based

 extraction. The one downside here is that your results in general are

 not going to be quite as

 good as writing out a dedicated schema. But you're still going to get

 JSON. And it's still

 going to be high quality JSON. Just at some extreme levels, you might

 notice that you're not getting

 quite as nice a structure as you might expect. So if you are writing

 a very critical data extraction

 task, you might want to go with the more hard coded structure, which

 we saw back over here,

 where you specifically list out all the different properties you

 expect to see inside of a schema like

 this.
