# Adding multiple tools

## Transcript

You might recall that the original goal of this project was to add in

 three separate tools,

 and right now we have only done one, just the get current date time.

 So now in this video,

 we're going to add in those two remaining tools, add duration to date

 time and set a reminder.

 Now I have already provided implementations of these other two

 functions for you,

 along with JSON schema specs, just to save us a lot of time with a

 lot of typing that we would

 need. So let's take a look at how we would wire up these additional

 functions along with their

 accompanying JSON schema specs. Now as a reminder, I've already got

 these implemented inside of

 one of the earlier code cells. So right here is add duration to date

 time. And then if you scroll

 down a little bit, there is set reminder. All it does is print out

 the timestamp and some content.

 So there's not an actual reminder system here, but you can kind of

 imagine a couple of different

 ways in which we might implement that. And then underneath that, the

 existing schema,

 here is the add duration to date time schema. And then finally, the

 set reminders schema.

 So again, all we really have to do is touch a couple of places to add

 in these schemas

 and wire the actual tool functions up to our run tools function. So

 let's get to it.

 Step one, I'm going to find the run conversation function. Here it is

 right here,

 and I'm going to add in those two additional schema that we just saw.

 So I have add duration

 to date time schema and set reminder schema.

 Then in the cell right above it, which is where we have all the tool

 running code,

 I will find the run tool function. And we need to add in two

 additional cases to this if statement

 to handle the case where Claude asked to use those two additional

 functions that we were just

 looking at. So one will be L if tool name is set reminder. And if

 that's the case,

 then I'm going to return a call to set reminder. And then L if tool

 name, add duration to date

 time. And if that's the case, we will call the appropriate function.

 And that should be it. So now I'm going to make sure I rerun the cell

. I will scroll down.

 I'll make sure I run run conversation. And now we should be able to

 test out the entire process

 of setting a reminder. So I'm going to say set a reminder to go to

 the doctor. The appointment

 is in 100 days. And run it. Now I might run into a rate limit here

 rather quickly,

 because at present, I have a rather low service quota. But I should

 at least be able to see a

 couple of steps here. Notice how right away Claude is giving us a

 great plan of what it needs to do.

 So it's going to try to get today's date. And that kind of like

 happens in between these two

 messages. We don't see it printed, but it does happen. Then Claude

 says, I need to add 100 days.

 So it's going to use the add duration to date time. And then finally,

 it calls the set reminder

 function as well. And so we see correctly right here, setting the

 following reminder for 100 days

 from my current date. Go to the doctor appointment. And that's it. So

 as you can see, once we write

 out all that kind of base code for implementing tool use, adding

 additional tools is really,

 really easy and straightforward. It's just that first little bit is a

 little bit challenging.

 And I hope you didn't lose your patience with me earlier on inside this

 module when we had to go

 over all that different message and part handling stuff.
