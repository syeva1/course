# Providing examples

## Transcript

I'm really excited about this next prompt engineering technique we're

 going to discuss

 because it is probably one of the most effective that you're going to

 find.

 It's the idea of providing examples inside of your prompt.

 This is often referred to as one-shot or multi-shot prompting,

 depending upon whether or not you

 are providing just one example or multiple examples.

 Understanding this concept is definitely easiest if you take a look

 at an example, so let's

 do that right away.

 Consider the prompt on the right-hand side.

 I'm asking Claude to categorize the sentiment of a tweet.

 Let's be clear.

 When we say sentiment, we mean kind of does this tweet seem kind of

 happy or positive in

 nature or unhappy or negative.

 In this particular instance, I provided a input tweet of, "Yeah, sure

.

 That was the best movie I've ever seen since Plan 9 from outer space

."

 Now if you're not aware, Plan 9 from outer space is a famously bad

 movie.

 So if someone were to tweet something like this, they're actually

 probably being sarcastic

 and they probably did not like the movie they just watched at all.

 So we would probably want to classify the tweet as being negative,

 but Claude could potentially

 have some issue categorizing this.

 One way to solve the problem would be by using multi-shot prompting.

 So here's how we would fix this.

 We would take our starting prompt we have on the left-hand side and

 add in some examples,

 which I've added in on the bottom half of the prompt right here.

 To add in an example, we will very directly tell Claude that we are

 about to give it some

 example input and an ideal perfect world kind of response.

 So almost always wrap these inputs and outputs inside of some XML

 tags just to better structure

 our prompt and make it super clear to Claude what the purpose of the

 input and output are.

 So in this particular example, I have given a sample input of great

 game tonight, which

 I would say is definitely positive in nature.

 So right after that, I would then put in an ideal output of simply

 positive.

 This gives Claude a concrete objective example of how to deal with

 some kind of input.

 Now Claude knows that if it ever sees some kind of input like this

 again in the future,

 well, it should probably label it as positive, because that's how it

 was done in the past.

 We can make use of multi-shot prompting, that's where we provide

 multiple different examples

 whenever we want to handle corner cases.

 And dealing with sarcastic tweets like this is definitely a corner

 case that we kind of

 want to highlight to Claude.

 When adding examples that highlight corner cases, add in some context

 to Claude and tell

 it that it should be especially aware of certain scenarios.

 So for example, we might say be especially careful with tweets that

 contain some sarcasm

 and then provide an immediate example of that.

 So now in this case, I've got a example tweet or a sample input of,

 oh, yeah, I really needed

 a flight delayed tonight.

 Excellent.

 If you didn't understand the concept of sarcasm, this would seem like

 a positive sentiment

 tweet.

 But of course, we can probably understand that this is sarcasm.

 And so probably is actually negative.

 Once again, Claude can take a look at this example when grading our

 provided input up

 here, the original input.

 And Claude will have a better chance of recognizing that, oh, yeah,

 this looks like it's sarcasm

 too.

 This is also probably negative in nature.

 Now multi-shot prompting like this can be used not only for capturing

 corner cases or giving

 a little bit more clarity to Claude, but also helping Claude

 understand more complex

 output formats.

 So if you ever need to generate a JSON object that is rather complex

 in nature, you might

 provide a sample input and an example output and show that kind of

 complex JSON structure

 to Claude.

 And now it will have a better idea of the exact structure of output

 that it is going

 for providing examples is especially effective whenever you are doing

 prompt evals as we

 currently are.

 Remember, whenever you run a prompt develop using our little

 framework inside the notebook,

 it creates an HTML file inside the same directory.

 So we can hunt through this file until we find a perfect 10 or

 hopefully just a test case

 with a rather high score.

 If I scroll through, I will find a 10 right here.

 Now you might not have any tens inside of your output.

 If you don't, that's totally fine.

 Just try to find the record with the highest score.

 So this is an example of where we had some input and output that was

 gauged to be pretty

 much as good as we're going to get by our model greater.

 So we might decide to provide this as an example inside of our prompt

.

 And hopefully that will guide Claude to producing output that looks

 like this a little

 bit more often.

 So let's try this out.

 I'm going to copy this input right here, go back over to my prompt, I

'm going to scroll

 underneath the guidelines section and I'm going to explicitly tell

 Claude that I'm about

 to provide an example that's going to contain a sample input and an

 ideal output.

 So I'll say here is a or an example with a sample input and an ideal

 output.

 I'll then put in my sample input inside of XML tags and a ideal

 output.

 And inside those tags, I'm going to go back over and copy paste the

 output from right

 here.

 I'll then paste it in like so and fix some indentation.

 Before we rerun our eval, there's one last thing I want to show you.

 This last step is completely optional, but I personally have had

 great success with it.

 It's often very beneficial to help Claude understand exactly why this

 is ideal output.

 If we go back over to our report, remember, we have this last column

 over here that explains

 exactly why the greater thought that this was some ideal output.

 So we can copy just the kind of first half of some message over here,

 where it says or

 lists out why this is a good response.

 Take that back over and then underneath the closing ideal output tag,

 we could paste in

 that reasoning and then maybe update the grammar just a little bit to

 say, this example meal

 plan is well-structured, blah, blah.

 So now Claude has a better idea of exactly why this is considered to

 be ideal output.

 And it's going to better reinforce the idea that Claude needs to

 return a well-structured

 output that contains some detailed information on the food choices

 and quantities and most

 importantly, matches the athlete's goals and restrictions.

 Okay, so let's now run that cell and then rerun our eval and see how

 we are doing.

 So I'm going to rerun this and are we going to go up or down?

 We end up going up just a little bit to 7.96.

 Well, let's wrap things up.

 As a reminder, this technique is often referred to as one-shot or

 multi-shot prompting.

 One-shot is where you provide a single example, multi-shot is where

 you provide multiple examples.

 And this is a technique you're going to very often use anytime you

 want to make sure Claude

 handles corner cases or especially when you want Claude to make sure

 it matches some kind

 of complex output format.
