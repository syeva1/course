# Streaming

## Transcript

I want to think back to our original chat interface example

just one more time.

So remember, we've got a chat interface

running on a website or maybe a mobile app.

A user is gonna submit a question,

or they're then going to take that text in our server,

put it inside of a user message, send it off to bedrock,

that's gonna give us back an assistant message,

we'll extract some text from that,

and then potentially send it down to the browser

where the actual generated text can be displayed to the user.

Now, this would all work,

but there's one big downside to it.

And that is that the time between sending that initial request

with the user message and get a response

can sometimes take a really long time,

depending upon the length of the response

that is being generated.

So it can take anywhere from maybe three seconds,

but it could also take maybe 30 seconds.

Most users' expectations are that whenever they enter

in some kind of initial message,

like how do I host a Postgres database,

they want to immediately start seeing some content

being generated on screen right away.

But they don't want to wait 30 seconds.

So to implement this kind of immediate feedback,

we can use a function that's kind of like converse,

it just works a little bit differently.

And that is the converse stream function.

Converse stream allows us to stream back a response.

It streams back some generated text

as it is being produced by our model.

Let me show you a couple diagrams

to make sure it's really clear how this thing works.

So once again, we're gonna have a user

submitting an initial question to our server.

We're then going to send a request off to bedrock,

this time using the converse stream function.

Then the response we get back

is gonna be a little bit different in nature.

Right away, we're going to immediately get back

an initial response.

There's not gonna be any generated text

inside this initial response.

It's really just gonna be a message from bedrock

that says, "Hey, we received your request,

"we are now generating some text."

We're then going to start to receive a stream of events.

We're gonna go into more detail

around exactly what these events are.

But for right now, just understand

that they contain pieces of the generated response

that we want to send back eventually to our user.

We're going to get a number of different events.

The number that we get depends upon

how much text we are generating.

Each event is gonna contain just a little bit

of the overall message that is being generated.

So maybe this first event has the text, "You can,"

and then the next one, "Host A,"

and then the next one, "Postgres."

In theory, we would probably have some

additional events after that to really flush the message out.

As we receive each event, we would take this generated text,

send it down to the browser,

and then hopefully our browser or mobile app

would display that part of the generated message on the screen.

And then we would repeat this process

for each additional event.

So we'd take the text, send it down to the browser,

and show that on the screen.

And eventually, we would stream in each chunk,

and so the user can start to read the response

right away as soon as possible.

Now, I wanna spend a lot of time

discussing the exact nature of these events,

because that's really the kind of challenging part

of understanding how a converse stream works.

But first, let's write out a little bit of code

just to get our hands on Converse Stream

and really understand it.

So back inside of a notebook,

I've once again got an initial set of messages

right here that starts off empty.

I've added in one message that just says,

write a one sentence description of a fake database.

Now I'm going to get a response

by calling clientConverseStream.

I'm gonna pass in my list of messages.

And of course, I still need to pass in my model ID.

And remember, our model ID keyword

is actually model capital ID,

but our model ID that we specified earlier

is model_id.

I'm then going to print out just the response for right now.

And when I run this cell,

you'll notice that it only takes about a second

for me to get the initial response back.

So again, this is the initial response

we saw in the diagram.

It's this thing or right here.

Inside of this initial response,

there's not actually any generated text.

Instead, we get this new key added inside of it of stream.

Stream is an event stream object.

Essentially, it's a generator that we can iterate over.

And each value that gets emitted

or yielded by that generator

is going to be one of these different event objects.

So let's update our code here a little bit.

I'm gonna change it to for event in response.

And remember that thing is specifically

at the stream key inside the response object.

I'm then going to print out that event.

I'll then run this again.

Let's see what we end up getting.

So now we start to get a stream

of different events being printed out.

And even though it's a little bit hard to see,

you might notice that when you run the cell,

you first see the first print or two,

like the first event print.

And then you start to see the other start to trickle in

with a little delay in between each one.

So let me show you a diagram that's gonna help you

understand what these event things are all about.

So again, whenever we make our request off to bedrock,

we're gonna get back a series of these different events.

There are several different kinds of events

that are going to be yielded by that generator.

And we can see these all being printed out

when we run that cell.

So we might see an event of type message start.

We then might see an event of type content block start

and then content block delta and so on.

If I go back over to Jupiter, I'll see those right here.

So here's message start.

I've then got some content block deltas.

And if I scroll down, I eventually get a message stop

and a metadata event.

Now, each of these different events

has a different meaning in the context of our response.

For right now, the only event that we're really

gonna be focused on is the content block delta.

Each content block delta event contains a little piece

of text that was generated by our model.

And this is the actual text that we eventually want

to probably show to a user or make use of in some way.

So if I again, look at my log right here,

I'll see that each of these content block deltas

have nested inside them a delta and then a text.

And then that is the actual text I care about.

So for me, I would end up with a generated message here

of the Xenonlin Q7 database is a revolutionary

yet entirely blah, blah, you see, so on and so on.

You are always gonna see these different events

listed out in the same order.

So we're always gonna end up seeing

a message start event first.

We'll then see some number of content block delta events,

then a content block stop, message stop and metadata.

Now, as we start to take a look

at some more advanced features of our model,

we might eventually see multiple content block start

and stops.

But for right now, when we're only generating text,

we're only going to get back a single set

of content block deltas and a single content block stop.

We're not even going to actually see a content block start,

even though that is an event.

So that is an event, but we're not actually gonna see it

if we're only generating text.

It's only gonna be relevant once we start

to go into tool use, which we're gonna cover

a little bit later on.

So again, for right now, the only event

that we really care about when we only care about text

is content block delta.

So with that in mind, let's update our for loop

back inside of our code.

I want to collect all the different content block

delta events.

Whenever we get one of these,

I want to try to print out the text inside of that event.

So here's how we would do it.

I'm going to update the contents of the for loop

and I'll say if content block delta in event.

So I'm just checking for the presence of that string

inside of this event dictionary.

Then I want to get the chunk text, which I'll call chunk

and that's going to be event at content block delta,

delta text.

And then I'll print out just that chunk.

Whenever we print out a chunk using the print function

of Python, it's gonna automatically append a new line

to the end of the print statement.

So it ends up being a little bit challenging

to read like this.

So I might recommend adding in the end keyword
