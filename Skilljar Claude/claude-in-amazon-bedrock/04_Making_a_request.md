# Making a request

## Transcript

Let's get our hands dirty and write out a little bit

of code. In this video we're going to focus on making our first

API request off to AWS Bedrock.

We are going to run a model and just generate a very small amount

of text. Now you'll notice that I've already created a Python

notebook. I would encourage you to pause the video right here and

create a notebook of your own so you can code along with

me just to get some experience in making these API requests.

In order to make our first request, we are going to need three

different things. First, we need a client to

actually access Bedrock. We're going to make this client

using the Bodo3 Python module. Second,

we need a model ID. This is going to be the ID

of the exact model that is hosted inside of Bedrock that

we actually want to run. And then finally, we also

need something called a user message. This

is going to be a very specially formatted object that

contains some amount of text that we want to feed into

the model. So back inside of my notebook, let me

show you how we're going to create that client, get the model ID, and

create a user message. First, I'm going to make a client

using the Bodo3 module. I'm going to specifically

connect to the Bedrock runtime and specify a

region name. In my case, I'm going to use US West

2. Next up, we need to designate our model

ID, which is going to be a string. Now, unfortunately,

the model ID is actually going to end up being a little bit

more complex than it might seem at first glance.

So let me show you a couple of diagrams, help you understand what's

going on. Now, as a reminder, whenever we

make a request off to Bedrock, we need to include the ID

of the actual model that we want to run. And we're going to send

that request off to a very specific region. In my case,

I put in US-S2. But there is a really

big gotcha here, something that's not super clearly

outlined in the documentation, but something that you very much

need to be aware of. It turns out that not every

single model is hosted in every region.

So for example, US East 1 is

another region in AWS. And US East 1

might not be actually running the exact model that I want

to execute. So if I were to send this request

into US East 1, I would probably end up getting an air message,

saying something about this model just plain not being available.

To fix that error, I could try to figure out which region actually

is hosting the model that I'm looking for. Or,

alternatively, I could try to keep track of what model

is hosted in which region. But there's an easier

way to solve this problem using something called an inference

profile. Inference profiles are used to route

requests to a different region where your chosen model

is actually hosted. So as an example, we might

have an inference profile that says that this particular

model is guaranteed to be hosted in U.S. West

2 and U.S. East 2. Here's what the inference

profile does behind the scenes. We are still going to make a request

off to some particular region hosted in AWS.

But rather than specifying a specific model ID,

we're going to instead specify the ID of an inference

profile. When we then send that request in, AWS

is going to automatically reroute our request to another

region where the model that we are looking for actually is hosted.

So the reason that I mentioned that this model ID

right here is a little bit tricky to understand is that it is referred

to as a model ID all over the place. But

in reality, we usually don't actually put in a model

ID. Instead, we provide the ID of an inference

profile so that we get that automatic request routing.

Let me very quickly show you an example of this inside of the

bedrock dashboard, just so this idea of an inference profile

is super clear. So inside of my bedrock dashboard,

I've gone to the model catalog on the left-hand side.

I'm then going to take a look at one of the Claude series of models.

Then on this page, if I scroll down a little bit, I

will see right here, yes, I have a model ID.

But again, this model ID is probably not what we actually

want to add into our request. Instead, what we're

probably going to want to use over here on the left hand side, I'll

find cross region inference. And if I click on

that, I'll then find the model that I'm looking for.

Here we go. And then on this page, I'll find

my inference profile ID. And that inference profile

ID is what we want, because that's what's going to automatically

route our request off to some region where our model

is guaranteed to be hosted. So I'm going to take that

inference profile ID, I'm going to copy it, and then

put it back over here inside of my notebook and assign it to

model ID. The last thing that we need to create before

we make a request is our user message. Remember

that this is a very specially formatted object that contains

the text that we want to feed into the model. I'm going

to make a variable down here called user message. It's

going to be a Python dictionary with a role of user

and a content that's going to be a list with another

nested dictionary inside of it with some text. The

text value is going to be whatever I want to feed into my model.

So in my case, I'm going to ask the model, what's

one plus one? Now, I'm going to tell you more about

the structure of the user message in just a moment. But

for right now, let's just focus on making a request to make sure

that we can actually generate some text. To make our actual

request, I'm going to go down a little bit and add in a call

to client.converse. We're going to

feed in our model ID and notice that the keyword argument here

is model ID with a capital I. I'm

also going to add in messages. That's going to be our list of messages.

In this case, we only have one. It's going to be the user message that we just

created. Then I'm going to make sure that I run both

cells. Then I'm going to add in a new cell

underneath this one and print out

response. There's a lot of information

inside this response, but if we look very closely, we can see that

we actually do get a answer to the question that I put in,

which was what is 1 plus 1? So I got an output

of 1 plus 1 equals 2. So if we wanted

to get just the generated text by itself, we would have to

write out something like response and then look up output

message. Content, zero,

text. So that's going to look at the output property,

look at message inside there, look at the content inside

there, look at the first element inside this list, and then get

our text, and that's where our generated text actually

sits. So if I now run this cell again, I'll see just

the generated text of 1 plus 1 equals 2.

Now very quickly, I'm going to make a change to this line. I'm

going to remove the content, the zero in text lookups,

and then run that cell again. Now I'm going to get a dictionary

that has a role of assistant and some content assigned to it.

And if you look at this dictionary, it might actually look a little

bit familiar. It looks rather similar to a structure we

created just a moment ago, specifically the user

message right here. So let me help you understand

what these message things are all about and what they do

for us. Messages contain the text

that we want to feed into our model, and they also contain the

text that eventually gets generated by the model as well. There

are two different types of messages, user messages and assistant

messages. So a user message is always going to

contain the text that we want to feed into the model. And

assistant messages are going to contain the text that was generated

by the model itself. The structure of these two different

message types are always going to be a very similar nature. The

only big difference between them is that a user message will always

have a role of user, and an assistant will always

have a role of assistant. Both message types

will always have a content property that we refer to a list.

And you might be a little bit curious why there's a list there at

all, why isn't it just some simple text property that tells

us whatever we fed into the model or what we got out.

The content property is a list because eventually

we're going to see that a single message can have many different parts

tied to it. For example, we might to send

a message into our model that contains both an image

and some amount of text as well. We would encode

the image and the text as separate parts inside

of this list of content items. We are not going

to worry about messages with multiple content parts inside

them just yet. I only mentioned it to help you understand why

there's that extra little bit of syntax. Okay,

so now we've made our first request successfully. Let's come back

in just a moment and go into a little bit more detail.
