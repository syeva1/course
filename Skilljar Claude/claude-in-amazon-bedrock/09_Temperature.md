# Temperature

## Transcript

Earlier on, inside this course, we spoke very briefly about how

 Claude actually generates

 text.

 Remember, we feed some amount of text into Claude, like the words "

What do you think?"

 Claude is then going to tokenize this text, or break it up into

 smaller chunks.

 Claude is then going to go through a prediction phase, where it

 decides what possible words

 could come next, and assign a probability to each of those different

 options.

 Finally, in the sampling phase, a token is actually chosen based upon

 these probabilities.

 So in this diagram I have on the screen, given inputs of "What do you

 think?"

 Possible next tokens might be about, wood, of, and so on, everything

 you see here on the

 right-hand side.

 Each of these gets assigned a probability, and then maybe, in this

 case, Claude settles

 on "about" as being the best possible next token.

 So we would end up with a phrase "What do you think about?"

 This entire process is then repeated to complete the sentence or

 complete the entire message.

 Now just to make sure things are really clear, the numbers I'm

 showing here are probabilities,

 the percentage chance of each token being selected.

 Just to make things a little bit more clear with these probabilities,

 I'm going to display

 them in a chart for the rest of this video.

 So still the same probability is just in a format that's easier for

 us to understand.

 You also notice I've kind of sorted them from left to right.

 There's no actual internal sorting going on.

 I'm just sorting them greatest to least probability, just to make

 this chart a little bit easier

 to understand.

 So now that we have a reminder on how Claude generates text, I want

 to show you one way

 that we can directly influence these probabilities and control which

 token Claude might actually

 decide to select.

 So we can control these probabilities using a parameter called "tem

perature."

 Temperature is a decimal value between 0 and 1 that we provide when

 we make our model call,

 so whenever we call that "converse" function.

 Temperature is going to influence the exact distribution of

 probabilities.

 This is a little bit tricky to understand, so you can look at the

 plot or these charts

 I've got right here, or alternatively, I put together a quick little

 demo with Claude

 itself just to give you a better idea of what's going on.

 So let me show you that demo.

 Okay, so this is the same chart we were just looking at in that

 diagram a moment ago.

 Whenever we provide a temperature value going down to 0, so you'll

 see I got temperature

 right here, the highest probability becomes more likely to occur.

 So our highest probability was about, and it's going to increase all

 the way up to 100%.

 So at temperatures of 0, we start to get what we call deterministic

 output, where we always

 select the token that has the highest initial probability.

 Then as we start to increase our temperature, it increases the

 chances of us selecting a

 token that has a lower initial probability.

 So we go from maybe having a 0% chance of selecting "we" as the next

 token, all

 the way up to say 9%. So this is the theory behind temperature, but

 what does this actually

 mean in the real world?

 Well, we start to use different values of temperature, given the

 actual task that we're

 trying to complete.

 These are some example ranges and tasks that might fit into each

 sample range.

 For something like, say, data extraction, we really don't want a lot

 of randomness or

 a creativity. If we give Claude a big chunk of text and ask it to

 extract very specific

 pieces of information, no real creativity required there whatsoever.

 We just want Claude

 to look at the exact text we provided and pull out the most relevant

 information.

 And then on the higher temperature side, this is where we start to

 get more creative, and

 we start to see less common tokens being used.

 We probably are going to want to use higher temperatures anytime you

're doing any kind

 of really creative focus task, such as brainstorming, writing, maybe

 doing some really creative

 marketing, or something like a joke where a lot of jokes really

 depend upon using words

 in ways that are not always quite expected.

 Now that we have an idea of what temperature is all about, let's take

 a look at how we

 can play around with it with the bedrock API.

 So the first thing I want to show you is in the bedrock documentation

 or specifically the

 bedrock user guide. Inside of here, on the left hand side, I've navig

ated down to Anthropic

 Claude models, and I'm taking a look at some documentation around

 Claude Sonnet.

 If I do a search on this page for temperature, and then go down a

 little bit, I'll finally

 find temperature right here, so a description of this parameter, and

 you'll see that by

 default, temperature is set to one. So that means that by default,

 whenever we access

 Claude through bedrock, we're going to usually get back some really

 creative responses, which

 may or may not be good. So we might want to control this temperature

 value to sometimes

 make sure that we're getting more deterministic output for tasks like

, say, data extraction,

 and then maybe we could adjust temperature depending upon whether we

 want a more creative

 task, like say, writing a script for a movie or something like that.

 So now back inside of Jupiter, I have the same notebook I was working

 on in the last video.

 I have added in a new cell here, where I've made a new list of

 messages. I'm adding in

 a user message where I'm asking Claude to generate a movie idea in

 one sentence. I then

 call chat, get back some text and print it out. And before running

 this, let's update

 our chat function. So it will take in an optional temperature

 parameter, and we'll pass that

 through to our converse call. So we can adjust the creativity of our

 model a little bit. I'm

 going to go back up to the chat function right here. I'm going to add

 in an additional argument

 of temperature, and I'm going to match the default temperature value

 of the model itself,

 which is 1.0. I'm then going to pass that through this params

 dictionary. So I'm going

 to put in a new key to this of inference config. And notice that this

 is the word inference.

 It is not interface. So make sure you get the spelling there correct.

 I'll then put in

 a temperature of whatever temperature was passed in. And that's it.

 So now if I rerun

 that cell just to redefine chat, I'll then go back down to the cell I

 had added down

 here to generate movie ideas. And remember, now we have a default

 temperature of one,

 I'm going to leave it like that for right now. And if I run this once

, I should get back

 a movie idea that it is at least somewhat creative. And if I read

 this over a reclusive

 origami master, this is a very creative movie idea, you can tell

 right away, I'll run it

 again. And we're definitely going to expect to get back another movie

 idea that is really

 creative. Okay, that also looks reasonable just one more. And yeah,

 reasonably creative.

 So now I'm going to add in the temperature and set it to flat zero.

 Now in theory, we're

 going to get back some ideas for movies that are a little bit less

 creative in nature perhaps.

 So if I run this, I'll see a time traveling archaeologist. Now it's

 kind of hard for you

 and I to just run this prompt a couple times and decide whether or

 not it is creative.

 But let's run this one or two more times. And I think you're going to

 notice a theme

 really quickly. Notice how this is a time traveling archaeologist. So

 if I run this

 again myself, I'm probably going to see another response here about

 yeah, there we go, a time

 traveling something related to history. I'll do it again. And I'll

 probably see again,

 a time traveling historian. So you can start to see right away that

 we start to get responses

 that are a little bit less creative and they tend to be rather

 similar to all other responses

 that we get when we feed in this identical initial prompt of generate

 a movie idea in

 one sentence. Okay, so that's temperature. Now remember, there's some

 general guidance

 here. Whenever we are doing tasks that require less creativity or

 where we want to have very

 deterministic output, we're going to use that lower temperature. And

 then whenever we have

 a task that requires a little bit more creativity, that's when we

 start to start to want to

 think about dialing up the creativity a little bit.
