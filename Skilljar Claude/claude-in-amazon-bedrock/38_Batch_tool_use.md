# Batch tool use

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to take a look at how we can parallelize

 tool calls by implementing

 something called a batch tool.

 Now, I first want to begin by reminding you something I told you

 about earlier on inside

 this module.

 Whenever Claude sends us back some tool use parts inside of a message

, so essentially

 tool requests, there can potentially be more than one tool use part

 inside of one single

 message.

 So take this example I have on the right hand side really quickly.

 If I sent in an initial query of something like what is March 12 plus

 50 days, also

 what is March 12 plus 100 days, then Claude in theory could send us

 back two separate

 tool use parts inside of one single message.

 The first one might try to calculate March 12 plus 50 days and the

 second one March 12

 plus 100.

 These are two operations or two tool calls that are absolutely

 parallelizable.

 They can be executed at the same time without any issue whatsoever.

 Now Claude, sometimes we'll try to do this in parallel, but it turns

 out that some versions

 of Claude don't try to call tools in parallel quite as much as you

 might wish.

 So there's a way that we can kind of trick Claude and that is by

 implementing another

 tool called the batch tool.

 This is another tool that we implemented in the exact same way as the

 others.

 That means that we still have to write out a tool spec and we also

 have to make some kind

 of function to handle whenever that tool gets called.

 Now the easiest way to understand the batch tool is to just walk

 through the implementation.

 So let's do that right away.

 The first thing I want to do is show you what happens if we put in

 that exact query that

 I just wrote out inside of that diagram.

 So what happens if we put in that March 12 plus 50 and plus 100.

 If I run this, I sometimes might see two parallel calls, but almost

 always I'm going

 to see two separate calls.

 So when I get some output back, if I scroll down a little bit and

 look at the message

 log, I will see in fact that I've got roll of assistant right here.

 So this contains one tool use request where it put in March 12 plus

 50 days, I then sent

 back a tool result and then right underneath that is a separate

 second call for the same

 tool this time with a hundred days.

 So very clear that Claude did not try to parallelize these calls,

 even though it absolutely

 could.

 All right, so now that we've seen that, yeah, doesn't always work

 quite as expected.

 Let's take a look at how we implement that batch tool.

 So first thing we would need is a spec.

 Once again, I have provided a spec for you inside of an earlier code

 cell.

 So if you scroll way up to that code cell that starts off with the

 date time imports,

 expand that thing and then go all the way down to the bottom.

 And here's the spec for the batch tool.

 And I'm providing these for you because it would just be a ton of

 typing if we were to

 walk through it together.

 So this tool is super simple in nature.

 It just tells Claude that it can run other tool calls simultaneously.

 And the input arguments to it is a list called invocations.

 Inside this list, there will be a variety of different objects and

 each object is going

 to have the name of some other tool to invoke and the arguments to

 pass to it.

 So we need to take each of these different invocation objects.

 We need to loop through it.

 We need to find each of the listed tools and call each one with the

 provided arguments.

 One other thing to notice here, the arguments are encoded as a JSON

 string.

 So we will have to do a little bit of JSON parsing as well.

 Once we call each of these different tools, we'll then assemble all

 the results and pass

 it back as though it were a single call to a single tool called the

 batch tool.

 Let me show you how we implement that.

 All right.

 So to get started, I'm going to go to the very bottom of the notebook

 once again and

 scroll up a little bit and find where we put together all the run

 tools code.

 At the top of the cell, I'm going to find the run tool function and I

'm going to add

 in another case here, I'll say if tool name is batch tool, then I

 want to return the result

 of calling run batch and I'm going to pass in the tool input and this

 time I'm not going

 to use the splat.

 So I'm not going to put in the star star, I'm just going to pass in

 the tool input directly.

 I'm then going to define this new run batch function right above run

 tool.

 And this will receive that tool input argument.

 Then inside of here, we're going to loop over all the different inv

 ocations.

 So for invocation in tool input invocations, remember invocation, we

 just saw the structure

 of this object or what this thing should really be inside of our tool

 spec.

 So inside of there, we should have a tool name, which will be the

 name property and some

 list of arguments, which should be invocation arguments.

 Remember what I told you just a moment ago, arguments is designated

 inside of that JSON

 spec as being a JSON encoded string.

 So we need to parse that with a JSON load string.

 So now we have everything we need to run the correct tool with the

 appropriate arguments.

 And we can do so by just reusing the run tool function.

 So watch how we're going to do this going to be going to be

 surprisingly simple, we'll

 say tool output and that will be run tool and we will pass in the

 tool name that we want

 to run and the arguments for it.

 And then finally, we need to collect all these different tool outputs

.

 So I'm going to make a list up here, I'll call it batch output.

 And I'm going to append into that.

 Then we will add in tool name with the tool name and the output that

 we got from it.

 And then finally down here at the bottom, I will return batch output

 like so.

 Okay, so that should be it.

 We've now got a function to run a bunch of other tools by just deleg

ating to the function

 we already had.

 So it was not that hard to implement.

00:é‹ƒ06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,620
 And now I'm going to rerun the cell and let's go back down to our

 test function.

 So run conversation right here.

 We just need to make sure that we add in the run batch schema.

 So it was actually called batch tool schema, I believe.

 There we go.

 And now it's time for us to do a test.

 And now if we take a look at the message log output, hopefully we're

 going to see one

 single tool request.

 And in fact, we do.

 So take a look at this.

 It really is quite interesting.

 We've got the initial user message.

 We then have our assistant message where it asked to use a tool.

 And in this case, it asked to use the batch tool and the invocations

 that it wants to

 run.

 So kind of the sub tools is going to be a call to ad duration to date

 time and ad duration

 to date time.

 The first one has the duration of 50 second has a hundred.

 So by just adding in this tool, we've kind of trick Claude into

 calling multiple tools

 in parallel.

 So this is a technique that I highly recommend you keep in mind

 anytime that you need to run

 multiple tools at the same time.
