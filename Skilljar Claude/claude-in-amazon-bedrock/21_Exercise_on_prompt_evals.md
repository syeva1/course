# Exercise on prompt evals

## Transcript

Let's try out an exercise to improve our prompt evaluation workflow.

So here's the task I'm going to give you.

I want to improve our model grader a little bit by providing it with

more

context on what a good solution should actually look like.

Now, at first glance, that might sound a little bit challenging, but

it turns out

you only really have to go through two steps to add in this

additional context.

So in step one, I would encourage you to go back to the prompt where

we generate

our data set and inside that prompt, try asking it for some solution

criteria

to be included in every test case.

So ideally, our test cases that could output should now have some

additional

solution criteria key, which might look like what you see right here.

So it might say something about what a good solution would look like.

Maybe you say, well, a good solution would include this

characteristic

and this characteristic and this characteristic.

Once we have this additional solution criteria, we can then insert

that

into our grade by model prompt.

So you might find the existing area of that prompt where we put in

our

solution to evaluate and then right after it, you might add in that

newly

generated solution criteria.

And that's all it would really take to give our model grader, a

little bit

better idea of what a good solution would actually look like.

As usual, I would encourage you to pause the video right now and give

this exercise a shot.

Otherwise, we're going to go through a solution right now.

So the solution really is just going to be these two separate steps.

Should be pretty straightforward to get started.

Back inside my notebook, I'm going to find our generate data set

function.

And inside there, I'll find the really big prompt we put in.

And then when we ask for each of these different test cases, I'm

going to say,

in addition to a task and the output format, I also want to get some

solution

criteria and then I'll put in a string right here just to give our

model an

indication of what this key should actually be.

So I'm going to ask for some key criteria for evaluating the solution.

And that's pretty much it.

So I'm going to rerun the cell.

I'm going to go to the cell underneath it and regenerate the data set.

Okay, just a couple of seconds.

It should be done.

There we go.

So now we should have an updated data set dot JSON file.

I'm going to open that file up and I should now see some updated

tasks in here,

still with the format, but now I've also got some solution criteria.

So the solution criteria, we can read over.

Of course, yours is going to look different than mine, but it's going

to get

going to give some idea on again, what a good solution will actually

look like.

Next up is step number two, we're going to find our grade by model

function

and specifically the prompt inside there.

And we're going to include this newly generated solution criteria,

again,

just to tell the model grader, what a good solution looks like.

So for that, I will go back to the notebook.

I will scroll down and find that grade by model function.

Here it is right here.

So I'm going to find the prompt.

We are already putting in the original task, the output that was

generated.

And then right after that, I'm going to put in some note to the model

and just

say, here's some criteria that you should use to evaluate the

solution.

So criteria, you should use to evaluate the solution.

I'm going to put in some tags.

And I'll tell you why we were adding in these tags very shortly as we

start to

discuss prompt engineering.

And then I'm going to interpolate in from the test case, our solution

criteria.

And that key right there, remember, our test case is really these

objects, each

these objects, one by one, so we know because we see it right here

inside this

file, there is a key inside that dictionary of solution criteria.

So we're taking that sentence right there and putting it right here.

All right, so now time to run the cell.

And we're going to rerun our pipeline and see how everything is

working.

So I'll go down to the run eval function.

And then right after that is where we actually execute everything.

So I'm going to run that and then we get our updated score back.

Now I want to print out the results really quickly.

Just so we can see how this is going to affect the actual output.

So we'll do another print of JSON dumps results with an indent of two.

So now we can see the output from our model.

So that's the actual produced output.

Here's our test case.

So we can take a look at the task and the solution criteria.

Here's the score in this case, it was nine.

And now hopefully our reasoning section, which is produced by the

model

grader, is going to be a little bit more fleshed out than it was

before

because we are including that solution criteria.
