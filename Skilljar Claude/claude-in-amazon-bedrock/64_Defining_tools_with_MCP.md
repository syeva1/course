# Defining tools with MCP

## Transcript

Let's start to make an MCP server for our CLI chatbot.

 As you saw, the CLI itself already works,

 and we can already chat with Claude,

 but there's no additional functionality

 around the MCP server tied to it just yet.

 So we're gonna work on adding in this MCP server

 that is gonna have two tools in it for right now.

 It is gonna have one tool to read a document

 and one tool to update the contents of a document.

 The implementation of the server

 is gonna be placed into the MCP server.py file

 inside of the root project directory.

 Inside of here, I've already gone through

 a little bit of work to set up a basic MCP server.

 And then I defined a collection of documents

 that are going to exist only in memory.

 And then finally, I put together some different to-do items.

 So these are different tasks that you and I

 are gonna complete inside of this file.

 For right now, as I just mentioned,

 we're gonna be working only on these first two items,

 writing out two tools.

 Now we have authored tools in the past,

 and we saw that, well, there's a lot of syntax there.

 There's those big JSON schemas,

 but I got good news for you here.

 In this project, we're making use

 of the official MCP Python SDK.

 So that's what this MCP packages

 that we're making use inside of here.

 This MCP package is going to create our MCP server for us

 with just one line of code, like what you see right there.

 This SDK also makes it really easy to define tools.

 To define a tool, all we have to do is write out

 what you see on the right-hand side over here.

 This will make a tool named Add integers

 with this description and two arguments

 that are going to be required to be passed into it.

 Once we write out a tool definition like this,

 behind the scenes, MCP is gonna generate a tool

 JSON schema for us, which we can then take

 and then pass off to bedrock.

 So right away, as you can see,

 it starts to get a lot easier to do

 some basic things like define tools.

 Now, as I mentioned, our first task is going to be

 to implement these two different tools.

 So let's go back over to our MCP server.py file right away,

 and we're gonna start to implement the first tool

 of reading a document.

 So the only goal here is to take in the name

 of some document and return the contents of it.

 All of our documents are already placed

 inside of this docs dictionary.

 The keys are the IDs or essentially names of a document

 and the value is a document's contents.

 So our tool is really simple.

 We're gonna take in one of these strings,

 look at the appropriate value inside this docs dictionary

 and then return it.

 That's all we need to do.

 So to implement this, I'm gonna find the first to do

 and right underneath it, I'm going to define a new tool

 by writing out @mcp.tool.

 I'm going to give this tool a name of read doc contents

 and a description of read the contents of a document

 and return it as a string.

 And remember, in a perfect world,

 we put in a really fleshed out description right here

 to make sure it's super clear to Claude

 exactly when to use this tool.

 But right now, just as usual to save a little bit of time

 and keep you from having to type out a bunch of text here,

 I'm just gonna leave in a very simple description.

 Then I will define my actual tool function.

 So this is the function to run

 whenever we decide to run this tool.

 I will call it read document.

 It's going to take in a argument of doc ID

 that is going to be a string.

 I'm going to set that to a field with a description

 of ID of the document to read.

 And then we need to make sure

 that we import this field class at the top.

 So I'm going to go up to the top

 and add an import from pydantic import field.

 Then back down here, inside of the function body,

 I'm gonna put in my actual implementation.

 So the first thing I'm going to do

 is just make sure I handle the case

 in which Claude asks for a document

 that doesn't actually exist.

 So I'll say if doc ID not in docs,

 so in other words, if the provided document ID

 is not found as a key inside of this dictionary,

 then I'm going to raise a value error

 with a F string of doc with ID, doc ID not found.

 And then if we get past that check,

 I'll go ahead and return the actual document.

 So I'll return docs at doc ID.

 And that's it, that's all it takes to define a tool.

 So we've specified the name of the tool,

 its description, the argument that is expected,

 its type and a description for that argument as well.

 All these different decorators and field types and whatnot

 are all gonna be taken together by this Python MCP SDK

 and it's going to generate a JSON schema for us.

 Now that we've implemented this first tool,

 I'm going to remove the to-do right there

 and then we will implement our other tool,

 the one to edit a document.

 So we're going to repeat the exact same process.

 I'll say MCP.tool, I'll give it a name of edit document

 with a description of edit a document

 by replacing a string in the document's context

 or semi-content with a new string.

 Then for the implementation, I'll call this function edit doc,

 actually we'll be consistent called edit document.

 And then we're going to take in a couple of different arguments

 here, first is going to be a document ID

 and then a old string to find

 and then a new string to replace the old string with.

 So let's write this all out, we're going to have a doc ID

 that will be a string with a description of ID

 of the document that will be edited.

 Old string will be a string

 with a description of the text to replace,

 must match exactly including white space.

 And then our new string,

 the new text to insert in place of the old text.

 So our document editing here is just a very simple find

 and replace, that's it.

 Once again inside of here, I'm going to make sure

 that Claude is asking for a document that actually exists.

 So if doc ID not in docs, raise value error

 with a f string of doc with ID not found.

 And then if we do find the correct document,

 here's how we will do our edit, we'll say docs at doc ID

 is docs at doc ID, replace old string with the new string.

 And that's it.

 All right, so just like that, we have put together

 two tool implementations really, really quickly.

 I can't repeat it enough.

 The finding tools with this MCP Python SDK

 is a lot easier than writing out

 the schema definition manually.

 Now that we've got both tools put together,

 I'm going to delete the to-do right there.

 Okay, so this is a good start.

 We have put together our MCP server

 and we've implemented two tools inside of it.
