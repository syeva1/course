# Sending tool results

## Transcript

On to the very last step.

 We are going to take that list of tool result parts

 that we just generated, add them all into a user message,

 and then take the entire conversation history

 and send it all off to Claude.

 So let's go back over to our notebooks

 and test this out really quickly.

 First, I'm going to scroll up to the cell right above.

 Now right up here, we called chat,

 and we got our list of parts,

00:00:21,800 --> 0 à¦ªà§à¦°à§‡0:00:24,920
 but we never actually added them into our message history.

 So in other words, right now,

 we do not have this part of the conversation

 inside of our list of messages.

 So I'm going to fix that really quickly.

 I will add in a add assistant message

 and put in the big list of parts.

 I'm then going to rerun that cell.

 Okay, next up, I'm going to go down.

 In the cell that we were just working in a moment ago,

 we had a call to run tools.

 Now it's totally fine to leave that in there,

 but I only have it in there for debug purposes.

 So I'm going to remove that call

 just to clean up my code in here.

 And then underneath, I'm going to take a look at messages

 and just to verify that I do in fact,

 have the original user message

 along with the follow-up assistant

 that has the tool use request.

 And there it is right there.

 So that definitely looks good.

 Next up, I'm going to add in a new code cell

 and call add user message.

 And to my list of messages,

 I'm going to pass in run tools

 with all the parts we got out of our initial response.

 So this is where we are going

 to run all those individual tools.

 And it's going to generate our list of tool result parts.

 And we're going to add those all into our conversation history

 inside of a user message.

 So once again, I'm going to run the cell

 and print out messages.

 So now I should see I've got my user,

 the assistant and user.

 And inside the assistant,

 I have my tool use requests.

 And inside the user message,

 I have my tool result responses.

 So now the very last thing we have to do is

 just take this list of messages

 and send it all off to Claude.

 So I'm going to add one more cell down here.

 And I'll get text and parts from calling chat with messages.

 And when we do this follow-up,

 we do have to include all the original tool schemas as well.

 If we don't include those tool schemas,

 Claude will end up being really confused and say,

 hey, wait a minute,

 I tried to call some tool named getCurrentDateTime,

 but where's the actual definition for that?

 So we need to make sure that we include

 that same list of schemas.

 So in other words, this right here.

 I'm going to copy that

 and just make sure that I added in.

 And then finally, I will print out text and run this

 and we'll see what we get.

 And hey, it worked.

 So I was able to print out the current date and time.

 Now, as we said at the very start of the series of videos,

 well, Claude already knows the current date,

 but it doesn't know the time.

 And so this is evidence that our tool is working

 absolutely correctly.

 We are 100% getting our time in there.
