# Introducing MCP

## Transcript

In this module we are going to focus on model context protocol. MCP

 is a communication layer

 designed to provide Claude with context and tools without requiring

 you, the developer,

 to write a bunch of tedious code. When you first get started with MCP

,

 you will see diagrams that look like this very often. It shows two

 major elements of MCP,

 namely the client and the server. The server often contains a number

 of internal components

 named tools, resources, and prompts. Now there's a lot of terminology

 here, so to help you understand

 all of this, we're going to imagine that we are building a small app

 and see how MCP fits into it.

 Our sample app is going to be another chat interface. It's going to

 allow a user to chat with Claude

 about their GitHub data. So if a user asks a question like what open

 pull request do I have

 across all my different repositories, the expectation is that Claude

 is probably going to make use of a

 tool to reach out to GitHub, access the user's account, and see what

 open pull requests they

 have, maybe open repositories or whatever else. The point here is

 that we would implement this

 probably by using a set of tools. Now one thing I want to mention

 really quickly is that GitHub

 has a tremendous amount of functionality. There are repositories,

 pull requests, issues, projects,

 and tons of other things. So to have a complete GitHub chatbot, we

 would really have to author

 a tremendous number of tools. If we wanted to build that sample app,

 we would be on the hook

 for authoring all these schemas and all these functions. And this is

 all code that you and I,

 as developers, would have to write, test, and maintain. That's a lot

 of effort, a lot of burden

 being placed on us. This challenge of making developers maintain a

 big set of integrations

 is one of the primary difficulties that model context aims to solve.

 MCP shifts the burden of

 defining and running tools from your server to something else called

 an MCP server. So no longer

 would you and I have to author this tool right here. Instead, it

 would be authored and executed

 somewhere else inside of this MCP server. These MCP servers can

 really be thought of as like

 an interface to some outside service. So I might have a GitHub MCP

 server that provides access to

 data and functionality provided by specifically GitHub, where

 essentially wrapping up a ton of

 functionality around GitHub and placing it into this MCP server in

 the form of a set of tools.

 So at this point, we have a very basic understanding of what a MCP

 server is. It gives us access to

 a set of tools that exposes functionality related to some outside

 service. And the benefit here is

 that you and I do not have to author all these different tool schemas

 and functions and so on.

 Now that we have this basic understanding, I want to address some

 very common questions that a lot

 of people have when they first learn about MCP servers. So three

 common questions that seem

 to always come up. The first common question is who authors these MCP

 servers? And the answer is

 anyone. Anyone can make an MCP server implementation. But very often,

 you will find that service

 providers make their own official implementation. So for example, AWS

 might decide to release their

 own official MCP server implementation and inside of it, it might

 have a wide variety of different

 tools available for you to use. The second common question is how is

 using a MCP server different

 than just calling a services API directly? Well, as we just saw, if

 we wanted to call a API directly

 such as GitHub, then we would have to author this tool ourselves. And

 now we can call GitHub

 directly. So what did we gain here? Well, all that really changed was

 we are now having to

 author the schema ourselves and the function implementation ourselves

. So simply by adding in

 the MCP server, we are saving ourselves a little bit of time. The

 final common question is more of a

 common criticism that you're going to see people have around MCP. And

 this criticism is most often

 coming from people who don't quite understand what MCP is all about.

 So very often, you will see

 people saying MCP and tool use are the same thing. Well, as I have

 just laid out to you, MCP servers

 and tool use, they are complimentary. They are different things, but

 they are complimentary.

 The idea behind MCP is that you do not have to author the tool

 function and the tool schema.

 That is something that is done for you by someone else and is being

 wrapped up inside of this MCP

 server. So at some level, yeah, they're kind of similar because we

 are talking about tool use in

 both cases. But MCP servers are really talking about who is doing the

 actual work. So if you ever

 see this criticism, again, it's usually because people don't quite

 understand what MCP is all about.
