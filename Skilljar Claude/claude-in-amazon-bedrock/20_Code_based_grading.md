# Code based grading

## Transcript

Next up we need to implement our code grader.

 So our code grader is gonna take in some output

 from the model and make sure that we get back

 just plain Python, JSON or regular expression

 without any kind of explanation.

 In addition, we should also make sure

 that we have valid syntax for whatever type of code

 we actually got.

 You might be kind of curious,

 how are we going to validate the syntax

 of say, Python at all?

 Well, we use a little trick for this.

 We're going to define three helper functions.

 One would be called validate JSON, another validate Python,

 and another validate RegEx.

 Then inside of each of those,

 we're gonna take whatever output we got from the model

 and try to either parse it as JSON,

 we'll try to parse it as a Python abstract syntax tree

 or AST, or we'll try to compile it as a regular expression.

 And then for each of these,

 if we successfully parse or load or whatever else,

 we'll return a full score of 10.

 Otherwise, if we get an error during this parsing operation,

 we'll assume that we completely failed the syntax check

 and return a zero.

 There is one other thing to be aware of here.

 In order to know which of these different validators

 or these kind of grading functions to run,

 we need our test case data set

 to include the expected format

 that we're going to get back for each output.

 So in other words, back here inside of our data set,

 on our first task, for me at least,

 I was expecting to get back a Python function

 and then JSON and then a RegEx.

 So we need to update our data set

 to include something like a format key

 that will say, hey, this output should probably be Python.

 This one should be JSON and this one a RegEx.

 Now, of course, I could just edit this file manually,

 but instead we will update our prompt

 that is generating our data set

 so that we can eventually generate

 really large data sets for testing purposes.

 Now in total, to do all this stuff,

 couple of different steps we have to go through.

 So just to help you understand the code side of it

 and keep everything in line,

 I came up with this quick checklist

 of items that we're going to go through.

 So our first item,

 add in functions to validate JSON, Python,

 and regular expressions.

 For this, I'm going to flip back over to my notebook.

 I'm going to find the run test case cell.

 I'm going to add a new cell right above it.

 And then inside there,

 I'm going to add those three functions

 that you just saw inside that diagram.

 Once again, to save a little bit of time,

 I'm going to paste them in here.

 You can always copy the completed code

 out of the finished version of this notebook.

 So at the top of the cell,

 I'm importing these two helper modules.

 I've then got the three different validator functions

 that we just saw.

 And then at the bottom,

 I have kind of a general purpose function

 to figure out which these different validators to use.

 So I've got grades syntax right here.

 That's going to take a look at the test case.

 It's going to look at the format in particular.

 So we need to make sure our test cases

 have that format property

 that I just mentioned a moment ago.

 And then depending upon that,

 we're going to call the appropriate format function.

 Okay, that is step one.

 So step two, we need to update our data set

 to make sure we include that format key.

 So for that, we'll scroll up a little bit

 and find our data set.

 Here it is right here.

 So generate data set.

 And I'm going to add onto the example output.

 On task, I'm going to add a comma at the very end,

 and I'll add in a format key.

 And inside of here, we'll say simply JSON or Python.

 Or regex.

 That's really all we have to do.

 So now if I rerun that cell

 and rerun the cell underneath it,

 that actually generates the data set.

 There we go.

 Now I'll go back over to my data set file.

 And I'll see, yes,

 I did in fact get the format inside there.

 And it looks like it matches up with the task perfectly.

 So the first task is create a JSON configuration.

 Got JSON, write Python, got Python,

 and then write a regular expression, and I got regex.

 Okay, onto step number three.

 Now this, we're going to update our draft prompt template,

 just to make sure that it's really clear

 that we only want JSON, Python, or regular expression.

 'Cause right now our draft prompt just kind of says,

 "Yeah, try to solve the task."

 So inevitably, we're going to get back some non-JSON

 or non-Python content,

 and we'll always be failing the actual validation check.

 So we're just going to give our prompt a little help here,

 give it some work that we know that it needs.

 So for step three, we'll go back down to our run prompt,

 which is where our draft prompt is,

 and I'm going to update the prompt just a little bit.

 I'm going to add in some notes,

 and I'll ask it to respond only with Python, JSON,

 or a plain regex.

 And do not add any comments or commentary or explanation.

 Next up, I'm going to make sure that we get back

 just that raw content that we really care about.

 And once again, to do so,

 we'll use a pre-filled Assistant message

 along with a stop sequence.

 So I'll add in a Assistant message right here.

 In my Assistant message, in this case,

 I'm going to put in three back ticks,

 and then usually, as we saw previously,

 we might put in something like JSON, or Bash,

 or Python right here.

 But in this particular case,

 we don't really know ahead of time

 the exact format that we expect to get back.

 We don't know if we're going to get back Python,

 or JSON, or regex.

 So one little cheat code here, one will work around,

 we could just put in code,

 and that kind of pre-filled Assistant message

 and tells Claude, hey,

 you're going to put some code inside of here

 without us having to specifically say

 this is going to be Python, or JSON, or regex.

 I'm then going to add on the closing stop sequence

 with back ticks like so.

 Lastly, we need to actually merge the scores

 from our model grader and the code grader together.

 So for that, back over here,

 I'm going to scroll down once again,

 and we will find our run test case function.

 So this is where we are running our model grader.

 Right underneath it,

 I'm going to put together the syntax grader for code grader,

 whichever you want to call it.

 So I'll say my syntax score,

 it's grade syntax.

 We need to pass in the output and our test case.

 And then finally,

 we're going to merge the syntax score together

 with the model score.

 I'm going to first rename score right here

 to model score just to be clear.

 And I'm going to take the average of these two scores.

 So I'll say score is going to be model score plus syntax score

 divided by two.

 And that should be it.

 So that's all it took to add in a little bit of code grading.

 So last thing to do is test this all out.

 To do so, we'll go down just a little bit here.

 So right underneath the run eval function

 is where we actually call run eval

 and calculate our overall average score.

 So I'm going to rerun this

 and remember it usually takes a decent number of seconds

 to complete.

 And after a short pause, I get a final score of 8.166.

 So now the question is, is this good or not?

 Well, the real answer to that is that we just don't know.

 The only way we're going to know

 is if we now try to change our prompt in some way

 and hopefully get a better score.

 So let's try out an exercise in the next video

 where we will try to change our prompt a little bit

 and hopefully improve our score.
