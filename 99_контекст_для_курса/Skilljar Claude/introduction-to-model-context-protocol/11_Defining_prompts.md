# Defining prompts

## Transcript

Last major focus we're going to have inside of our MCP server

is going to be on prompts. Once again, just like

we did with resources, we're going to implement a small feature

inside of our project. And we're going to use this feature to

understand what prompts are all about, just like we did with

resources a moment ago. Let me tell you about the feature we're

going to add into our program. We're going to add in

support for slash commands. So

for example, I want to have a format command. I've

got some screenshots over here of how it's going to work.

Whenever user types into slash, we're going to list out some number

of commands that are supported by our application. For

right now, we're going to have just one command called format. So

if I type in just slash, I should see a little autocomplete

right here, and the only autocomplete option should be format.

If I then select Format, I should be prompted

to add in some document ID after it. So

one of our different document names like report.pdf or

whatever else. Then whenever user runs

this command, the goal is to get Claude to

reformat this document using Markdown

syntax. So in other words, take the plain

string that we have without any special formatting tied to

it inside of each of our documents right now. Remember,

inside of our MCP server, our current document

content is just plain text. We want to feed

this into Claude and somehow get Claude to rewrite

it using Markdown syntax. So I would

expect to see some output like this, something that says, I'll

help you reform out the document. Claude is then going

to use a tool to read the contents of the document. And

then finally, inside the final response, I want to see the content

of that document rewritten down here in Markdown

syntax. Now, there's something interesting about

this feature that I want to point out. The real core

of this feature, like the real goal here, is to allow

a user to reformat a document into

Markdown syntax. And that is an operation

that actually doesn't require you and I,

the developers, to write out any code to implement.

What do I mean by that? Well, a user can already

launch our CLI and say something like reformat

the report.pedia file in

markdown syntax.

I use your can already do this. No issue whatsoever.

And Claude is going to do a reasonable job of it. It's going to take

the contents of our document and reformat it into markdown.

And as you can see right here, it worked entirely perfectly.

So what are we really doing with this feature? Well,

the thought process here is that if we just left this up to

users and allowed them to manually type in something

like convert this to Markdown, they might get a OK

result, but they might get much better result

if they had a really strong prompt that is custom

tailored for this particular scenario of converting a

document into Markdown. So a user might be a lot

happier if you and I sat down as

the MCP server authors and wrote out and

tested and evaluated and went through the entire process of evaluating

our really thorough, fantastic prompts

like the one you see on the right hand side. So again, just

repeat, yes, a user can execute this entire workflow

on their own, but if they use this fancy prompt over

here, instead, well, I think they would be all the better.

This is the real goal of the prompts feature inside

of MCP servers. The thought here is that

ahead of time, we can define a set of prompts inside

of our server that are custom tailored to whatever

our server is really specialized to do. In our case,

our server is all about managing documents, reading

documents, editing documents, and so on. So we might

decide to add in a set of prompts that are very

high quality that have been evaluated and tested, and

we know that they work in a wide variety of different scenarios. We

can then expose these prompts for use inside

of any client application, like the CLI app that

we are putting together right now. Now, one thing I want to point

out here is that we could develop this prompt and just

put it directly into our CLI code base.

That is totally possible. We could do that, obviously. But

again, the thought here is that your MCP server that

might specialize in some particular task might

expose some number of prompts that people can just come and use

without having to worry about developing them ahead of time.

To define a prompt inside of our MCP server, we're going to write

out a little bit of syntax very similar to the tools and

resources we have already put together. We will use the prompt

decorator. We'll add a name to the prompt and

optionally a description as well. Then whenever

the client asks for this prompt, we'll send back a list

of messages. These are actual user and assistant

messages. So we can take the messages and send them off

to Claude directly. All right, so let's go over

to our server, and we're gonna try putting together our own prompt.

And just like you see right here, it's gonna be all about taking the contents of

a document and somehow rewriting it in Markdown

format. Okay, so back inside my editor,

I'm gonna find my MCP server file. I'm gonna go down

a little bit to the comment about rewriting

a document in Markdown format. I'll

delete that to do, and then I'll add

in a MCP prompt, the

name of format, and

a description of rewrites the contents

of the document in Markdown format.

I'll then add in an actual implementation. So

format document, I can receive

as an argument a doc ID, and

then optionally we can add in a field description here

as well, just like we did with our tool earlier

on. So I can optionally add in a field with

a description of ID of the

document to format. And I'm also going to add

in a type annotation of string. Just make sure that's

really clear as well. From this function, we are going to return

a list of messages.

I'm going to make sure I add in an import for this base thing at

the top right away. So right underneath

the existing MCP server import, I will add in from

MCP server fast MCP

prompts import base. Then

back down at the bottom. Inside of here, we're going to define

our very well-tested, very well-evaluated prompt.

I wrote a prompt out ahead of time. I'm going to paste it in like

so. So this prompt is just asking Claude

to take in a document ID. Implicitly,

we are kind of asking Claude to fetch the document ID's

contents using the redocument tool. And then after

getting that document, just go ahead and rewrite it with Markdown syntax.

And finally, after rewriting it, edit the document

as well to save those updates inside of our server.

Now, after defining this prompt, we're then going

to return a list of messages. So down here,

I'm going to return a list with base

user message, and I'm going to feed in

our prompt that we just wrote out to it, like so.

Now I'm going to save this file, and then let's go start

up our MCP development inspector and test

out this prompt from that interface. So at my

terminal, I'll run that same command again, and then

navigate to that address inside of my browser. I'll

make sure I connect to my server. I'll then find the

prompts section. I'm going to list out all the different

prompts that are available to us. And at this point in time, we have one

prompt, just format. So I click on

format, and then I have to enter in a document ID right here.

Let's, this time around, maybe we'll put in a

document ID of how about outlook.pdf.

So I'll put that in. And then get

prompt. And then here is our list of messages.

So these have been put together ahead of time. I've got one

message part here. So a text part with

our full prompt right there. We could see that

the document ID was interpolated into it. Now

that we have these messages, we can send them off to Claude.

And hopefully we're going to get back some appropriate kind of response.

So once again, the entire idea here behind these

prompts, we might implement inside of our MCP server, is

that the prompts we are defining are going to be well-tested,

well-evaluated, really specialized to one particular

use case.
