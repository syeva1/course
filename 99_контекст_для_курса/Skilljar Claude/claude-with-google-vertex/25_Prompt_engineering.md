# Prompt engineering

## Transcript

Now that we've got a handle on prompt evaluation, we're

going to move on to the world of prompt engineering. Remember, prompt

engineering is all about taking a prompt we've written and improving

it in some way to get more reliable outputs and higher

quality outputs. To understand prompt engineering,

we're going to go through a series of videos in this module, and

I want to very quickly help you understand how the module is set up.

In this video and the next, we're going to write out an initial

prompt. And then in the coming videos, we're going to

try to improve it step by step by implementing

new prompt engineering techniques on that original

prompt. So in short, in this video, we're going to set

a goal. So something we want our prompt to do, we're

then going to write an initial version of that

prompt. So kind of like a really poor first attempt.

We will then eval the prompt, and then we're going to

see right away we get a very poor evaluation

score. And then as I mentioned in the coming videos,

we're going to learn about and apply some different prompt engineering

techniques. And as we apply each of these, we're going

to run our evaluation again and see

that we are getting better performance with every single improvement

we make. Now to run these evals, we're

going to use that same kind of eval pipeline that

we put together in the previous module. Just

one little twist here, something you really need to be aware of if

you want to follow along and code with me. I

took our original eval pipeline that we put together

in the last module, and I made a couple of different

improvements to it to make sure that it can work with just

about any prompt, as opposed to the very specific

prompt we were working on previously. So

to get this updated notebook that has this more flexible

evaluation pipeline, make sure you download

the accompanying notebook named 001

underscore prompting. Before you open up that notebook,

however, I want to very quickly tell you about the goal of our prompt.

So this initial prompt that we're going to write and exactly what

it is intended to do. All right, so we're

gonna make a prompt that's going to hopefully generate a

one-day meal plan for an athlete based

upon their height, weight, some kind of physical

goal that they might have, and any dietary restrictions

they might have. So you can imagine

that we are going to take in some kind of sample input that

describes an athlete. Maybe there are height, weight, goal,

and dietary restrictions. We're then going to interpolate

all those inputs into our prompt. And then

we're going to send that off to our model. And hopefully we'll

get back some kind of output, like what you see on the right-hand

side. This is what we're really going for. This is our ideal

output. In the first version of our prompt, we're

going to get some output that looks nothing like what you

see here on the right-hand side, but through a variety of different

prompt-engineering techniques, we're going to eventually refine the prompt

and eventually hopefully get something that looks almost exactly

like this. All right, so now that

we understand our goal, let's open up that

new notebook. So remember, 001 prompting. I

can give you a very quick tour of it because there are a couple of

things have changed compared to the last module. And just make

sure everything inside there is super clear. We'll then

use the notebook to generate our initial data set.

All right, so I've opened up that notebook. Right away, you'll

notice there are a couple of collapsed cells at the top. So

this is a lot of different setup code. Just make sure you execute

those cells at least one time. So I can do so right

away. Next up, you'll see

that I'm creating an instance of something called a prompt evaluator.

Prompt evaluator is a class I created that wraps

up all the data set generation, all the model grading,

just about everything is wrapped up inside of this class.

The class takes one argument, max concurrent

tasks. So this class supports concurrency.

We can make multiple API calls at the same time.

The upside to this is that it's going to dramatically speed up our

eval process and the data set generation process as

well. But I do need you to be aware that

depending upon your service quota, you

may or may not very quickly start to run into some rate

limit errors. So if you see any rate limit

errors at all, as you go through this module, I would highly

encourage you to change this value right here all the way

down to the default of one. which means no

concurrency at all. For me personally, I

have super high rate limits. So I'm going to dial

this all the way up to a concurrency of 50. Chances

are you are not going to be able to use 50. So don't

try 50. I would really recommend maybe starting off at three.

And then if you see any rate limit errors, start to go down to two

or one. Again, I'm going to use 50

just so you can see some immediate feedback on my screen as

I run all these different steps. I'm

going to make sure I run that cell. And then let's

get started on generating our actual data set. So

to generate the data set, I've added this new generate data set

method for us. To use this method, we're going to

describe the overall purpose of our prompt.

So kind of what our prompt is supposed to do. For

you and I, we're trying to work on a prompt that is going to

write a compact, concise,

one day meal plan for

a single athlete. And

then inside of this prompt input spec, we're gonna have a dictionary

that's gonna list out all the different inputs that our

prompt requires. As we saw just a moment ago,

our prompt is gonna require a height, a weight, a

goal, and some dietary restrictions. So

these are some extra properties that are gonna be generated

as a part of the data set. And eventually we're gonna take them, test

case by test case, and interpolate them into our prompt.

So I'm gonna fill out all four of these different properties. My

height is going to be the height in CM

and just be clear I'll put in athlete's height.

And I'm going to duplicate that because it's going to be just about the same. We're going to do

our weight in kilograms. My

goal is going to be the goal of the athlete

and my restrictions will

be a dietary restrictions

of the athlete. And

the last input for you to be aware of is number of test cases

to generate. I would really recommend that you just leave

this at three because it's going to allow you to get through this module

way faster because the evals are going to run much more

quickly. Just remember, as I mentioned many

times whenever we do an eval in reality, we want to have

a really solid, really large number of test

cases. So I'm going to dial mine personally

way up. I do not recommend you do this. I recommend

you leave it at like two or three, just

to make sure all your evals run very quickly. But

again, I'm going to dial mine all the way up to 50. Once

I put this all together, I'm going to run the cell and that's going to generate

my data set. Once I have generated

my data set, I can open up the data set.json

file, which should be created in the same directory. And we're

going to see all these different individual data sets have been generated.

So they have a pretty similar structure to what we were doing on

our previous module when we were talking about prompt evals. I'm

going to go back over to my notebook and then scroll down

a little bit to the run prompt function.

This is where we are going to write out our prompt and then eventually

improve it over time. This function gets called

one time for every test case that you generated. Whenever

this function is called, it's going to receive your test cases

prompt inputs as its only argument. So

in other words, prompt inputs right there is going to be that

dictionary. And then that function is going to be called again, and

it will be that dictionary, and then again, and it will

be that dictionary and so on. So we're going to

take this dictionary and we're going to interpolate

those inputs into this prompt that we're going to write out right

here. Let's immediately write out a first

version of our prompt. And it's going to be very simple,

very naive. We're going to get a very bad eval score,

but it will at least get us started. So I'm going

to write in my initial starting frontier and I'm going

to use a very bad prompt. I'll say, what

should this person eat? And

then I'm going to list out their height. their

weight, their goal, and

dietary restrictions. And

then for each of these, I'm going to interpolate in a value from

prompt inputs. So the first one will be the height.

And I'm going to copy paste that just

to save a little bit of time and update the keys on each

one. So make sure you have first height and then we

want the weight and then our goal and

then restrictions. All

right, once we have our starter prompt in here, I'm

going to run that cell. And then let's do

our eval. So we can run our eval down here

at the very bottom. Now, before we run our eval,

I want you to know that this function that's going to actually kick off the evaluation

process, it takes in one additional keyword argument

that I'm not showing here. It's called extra criteria.

It's going to be a string. This string is going to be used during the model

grading process. This extra criteria thing

just allows you and I as developers to put in some

extra criteria that the model should consider whenever

it's doing some grading. So I'm going to say specifically

to make sure that the output should

include a daily

caloric total, a

macro nutrient

breakdown, and meals with

exact foods, portions, and timing.

Again, this is just going to add in a little bit of extra

validation or a little bit of extra grading criteria. All

right, so now let's run our evaluation for the

first version of our prompt and see how we're doing.

All right, we get a absolutely terrible

score. I get a 2.32. Now,

just so you know, you are probably going to end up getting a much

better score than I get. The reason I have a

very bad score here is that I'm using a model,

an older model, that is not super smart. So

it's going to tend to give me really bad output unless

I'm very specific in how I prompt it. I

am using this very bad model just so you can see

the increase in score over time as

we go throughout this module and add in all these different

prompt engineering techniques. So again, you

are probably going to get a better score. That's totally fine. Now,

before we move on, there's one last thing I want to mention really

quickly. Whenever you run any valuation, a

file will be created in the same directory as your notebook

called output.html. If you

open up that file inside of your browser with a simple

drag and drop, you're going to see a really nicely formatted

report that gives you output on every single test case that

was executed along with the score, the reasoning, solution

criteria, and so on. And you can also see the actual

output too. So I'm going to use this little dashboard

quite a bit in order to take a look at the output of the eval

and understand how I actually need to improve my prompt.

All right, I apologize for the long video here, but now

hopefully you have an idea of some of the setup

that we're doing inside of this module. So now all we really

have to do, as you can see, we have really bad score

right now. All we have to do is start to improve our prompt. So

let's start to take a look at our first prompt engineering technique

in the next video.
