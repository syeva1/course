# Structured data

## Transcript

stop sequences, and assistant message prefilling

can be combined together in a really powerful way.

Something that you're probably going to end up doing rather frequently, anytime

you need to generate some kind of structured data. So

to help you understand how these things work together, we'll me walk

you through a really quick example. Let's imagine that

we are building a web app like the one you see on the screen. This

is a web app that's going to generate event bridge

rules based upon some user input. If you're

not familiar with them, event bridge rules are used in AWS,

they're essentially little JSON snippets. So, user

is going to enter in some prompt like this and then click on generate.

In chances are, the user is going to want to see some generated

rule just up here that they can very easily

select right away or click on this little copy button

and go use somewhere else. The point there is

that part of the critical user experience here

is that we want to show just the JSON for the generated rule

and nothing else. So if we instead displayed

a response that looks like this, it would definitely not

be as helpful for our users. We're still generating

the rule, but now it also has this header up top and

this commentary footer down at the bottom. So now

a user can't really use this copy all button.

They would have to go in and manually select that JSON right

there. So this is an example where we really

don't want Claude to be that helpful and explains

work. We want just some very particular

data and nothing else. Now to be clear, this

is not a problem that is just limited to generating

JSON. It turns out that any time you are using Claude to

generate any kind of structured data. So it could be JSON,

or it could be Python, or even just a bulleted list

of text items. Claude is very often

going to try to insert a header or a footer or some

additional kind of commentary. And in many of these scenarios,

you don't want that additional commentary. You just want

the raw content that you asked Claude to create.

So to help keep Claude on track here and only give

us the raw content we're asking for and no additional

header or footer or commentary or anything like that,

we can use our stop sequence in combination

with a pre-filled assistant message. Let me show

you how. I'm going to go back over to my notebook.

I'm going to continue on by making a new cell down here. I'm

going to again make a list of messages. I'll

add in a user message. I'll

say something like generate a

very short event bridge rule

as JSON. I'll then pass that off

like so, and then let's just see what we get with this kind

of initial take. So right away, we can see that

we do get back some JSON, but it has unfortunately

that little back tick, back tick, back tick,

JSON right there, and then a matching closing one over

there. And just to make sure it's super clear, these

back ticks are in place to format this all as markdown.

So it gets formatted very nicely if you were to render it as

markdown text. But in our case, we don't want

any of those additional characters. We want just the raw JSON

by itself. So to do so, we

can do two things. We're going to use both an assistant message and

a stop sequence. For right now, we're just going to write out

the code to do so. And then I'll show you a diagram that explains how

it all works. First, I'm going to pre-fill an

assistant message. So let's say add assistant message.

And my pre-fill message will be backtick, backtick,

backtick, JSON. And then on

my chat call, I'll add in stop sequences.

And anytime we see a back

tick, back tick, back tick, I want to immediately stop

generation. So let's now run the cell

and see what we get back. Okay,

so now we get just the JSON by itself. You will

notice that there are some new line characters in here, but that's totally

fine. We can very easily remove those extra

new lines by just parsing the response as JSON

or by doing a strip call. So I could say

text is chat. I'll print out text and

then on the next cell down, I might import JSON

and do a JSON loads with

text and strip on

text as well. And if I run that, yes,

we definitely get back some very well-formatted JSON

here that we can access in any way that we expect. All

right, so what exactly is going on with the assistant message

and the stop sequence? Well, let me show you diagram just to break

it all down and make sure it is super clear. So

once again, we are doing our user message. We're providing

a pre-filled assistant and a stop sequence.

Claude is going to take a look at all the different parts of this request.

It's going to initially take a look at that user message content and say,

all right, it's very clear that I need to write a

full rule. And I should probably also describe it.

So maybe put on a header and a footer because that's kind

of what Claude naturally wants to do. It wants to explain

the work that is doing. But then it's going to encounter

that assistant message. And just as we learned in the last video,

Claude is going to assume that it already wrote that out in

its response. So it's going to say, oh, I've already

started the JSON part. So now all I have to do

is write out the actual JSON. It's

then going to write out all of this JSON

in the response. And then as it gets to the very

end, it's going to naturally want to close off

that markdown code block that it thought it created

earlier. So Claude is going to want to put in a closing

backtick, backtick, backtick. As soon as it does so,

however, it's going to encounter the stop sequence, which

stops the generation entirely and immediately sends us back

the response. So you can really imagine that what's

really going on here is we're kind of saying, start with this

and with that and just give us everything

in between. And that results in us just getting

back the part we really care about, just the JSON by

itself. And like I mentioned, this is a really

powerful technique that we're going to use very often. Anytime

we want to generate some kind of structured data and

get just that data with nothing else besides it.

And remember, this technique can be used for any kind of structured data.

It is not limited just being used on JSON.

So anytime we have any kind of very specific content we want to generate

and get just that content with no additional commentary

on it, we're going to take a look at using assistant message

prefilling along with stop sequences.
