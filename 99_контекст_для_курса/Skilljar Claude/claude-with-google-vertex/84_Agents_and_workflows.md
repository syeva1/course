# Agents and workflows

## Transcript

In this module, we are going to focus on workflows and

agents. Let's dive in immediately and understand

what these things are. Workflows and agents

are strategies that we use to handle the user tasks that

can't be completed by Claude in a single request. Believe

it or not, you have already been creating workflows and

agents throughout this course. For example, when learning

about tools, we fed tasks into Claude and

relied upon Claude to figure out how to complete them using

some provided tools. That was an example of an agent.

Now here's the rule of thumb that we use whenever we are trying

to decide whether to create a workflow or an agent.

If we have a very precise idea of the task we need to

complete and we know the exact series of steps that are

used to complete it, we'll use a workflow. Otherwise,

if we're not really sure about the details of a task that Claude

needs to solve, we'll use an agent. In this video

and the next couple, we're going to be 100% focused on

workflows. I'm going to show you several examples of

workflows, so let's take a look at our first one right

now. Let's imagine that we are building a small web application.

The goal of this app is to allow a user to drag and drop an image

of some metal part onto the screen. We're

then going to take that image and then somehow build a 3D

model out of it. We're then going to get the user back, something

called a step file. Now, if you're not familiar with a step

file, don't worry, a step file is just an industry

standard way of communicating or sharing 3D models.

So essentially, we're making a 3D model out of an image.

Now, even if you are not very familiar with 3D modeling, with a little

bit of help and a little bit of time, I bet you could figure

out a way to implement this application. Here's

how we might do it. We might take the image that the user

uploaded and feed into Claude and ask Claude to

describe this object in great detail. Then

we could take that description, feed it back into Claude

separately, and ask Claude to use a Python library

called CAD Query to model the object. CAD

Query is a Python library that allows you to do 3D

solid modeling, and you can output a step file

from that process. Now, it's entirely possible

that Claude is not going to get this model entirely

accurate the first time around. So once we build out this

initial model, we might decide to add in a little error

checking step, where we could create a rendering

as a plain image, and then feed that image

back into Claude and ask it how well this

image represents the original image that the user uploaded.

And if Claude decides that there are major issues in our rendering,

we can then go back to the second step and ask Claude to attempt

to render the part again. We can then repeat this

process over and over again until hopefully we eventually end

up with some kind of accurate model of the original part.

Now the important thing to understand here is that this is an

entire flow of steps that we can kind of imagine

ahead of time. We can sit down and design out this

entire process. We could easily write out some code to implement

it. As a matter of fact, I have previously implemented

something almost exactly like this. Because we can explicitly

list out and detail all these steps ahead of time, we

would refer to this as a workflow. Remember, we

define a workflow as a series of calls off

to Claude meant to solve some very specific problem,

where we really know exactly what those steps are supposed to be

ahead of time. This modeling workflow that I've described

is an example of something we call an evaluator

optimizer. The idea behind this workflow is that we

push some input into something called a producer. In

our case, the producer is Claude using the CAD

Query library to model a part and then creating

a rendering out of it. This output, the

rendering, is fed into something called a grader. The

grader will look at the output and decide if it meets some criteria.

If it does, then the workflow ends. Otherwise,

if the output doesn't meet some criteria, feedback

is given back into the producer, which gets an opportunity

to improve the output in some way. This cycle

is then going to keep on repeating until eventually the grader

accepts the output. Now, at this point in time, you've

probably got a somewhat reasonable idea of what this evaluator

optimizer thing is all about. But you're probably wondering, OK,

what exactly is going on with these workflows? So there's

just something I want to clarify here really quickly. Identifying

workflows doesn't really inherently do anything

for us. We still have to write down and write out the actual

code to implement these things. The only reason that we are

discussing workflows and the reason that you're going to see workflows as

a popular discussion topic is that many other

engineers have implemented workflows using these exact

same patterns and found a lot of success. So

the reason I'm showing you these different workflows is so that you can

use these same patterns on your own projects and

hopefully find some success with them because they have worked

well for other engineers.
