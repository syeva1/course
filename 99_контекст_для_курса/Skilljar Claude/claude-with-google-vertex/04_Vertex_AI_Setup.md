# Vertex AI Setup

In the next video we will be making a request to Vertex AI in order to call a Claude model. To do so, you need to go through a little bit of setup.

Step One: Ensure Anthropic models are enabled in Vertex
In your browser, navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/dashboard
In the left hand nav, click on 'Model Garden'

In the 'Search models' box, enter 'Anthropic'

Click on the model that you want to use.
Step Two: Enable the Model
Once you've found the model you want to use, you may need to enable it. On the model information page, click the 'Enable' button
If you don't see an 'Enable' button then you already have access to the model

Step Three: Install the gcloud CLI

If you don't already have the gcloud CLI installed, follow the directions here to install and authenticate with the CLI: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

Step Four: Login and set up authentication with the gcloud CLI

If you have not already logged in to the gcloud CLI, do so by running:

gcloud init
gcloud auth login

Then, set your project ID and set your default credentials:

gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud auth application-default login

That's it! The Anthropic SDK will automatically use these credentials when attempting to access Vertex.
