# Workflows vs agents

## Transcript

Let's wrap up by comparing and contrasting some

different aspects of workflows and agents. First,

recall that workflows are a predefined series of calls

to Claude. We often use workflows when we have a good idea

of the exact series of steps that are needed to complete

a task. With agents, on the other hand, we

don't know exactly what task will be provided, so

we instead provide a solid set of basic tools

and expect Claude to combine these tools together to complete

a given task. You might have noticed that a common

theme around workflows is that we take a big task

and we divide it up into much smaller tasks. Each

of these smaller tasks are much more specific in nature, allowing

Claude to focus on a single area at a time. This

increased focus generally leads to higher accuracy

for completing a task compared to agents.

Because we know the exact series of steps that a workflow executes,

they're also far easier to test and evaluate.

With Agents, we aren't constrained to a series of

steps etched in stone. Instead, Claude

can creatively figure out how to handle a wide variety

of challenges. Along with this flexibility, we

also get flexibility in the user experience. While

workflows expect to receive a very particular set of inputs,

Agents can create their own inputs based on queries

received from the user, and Agents can also ask user

for more input when it's needed. The downside

to agents is that they generally have a lower successful

task completion rate compared to workflows because

we are delegating so much work to Claude. In

addition, they're also harder to test and evaluate,

since we often don't have a good idea of what series of steps

an agent will execute to complete a given task.

At the end of the day, agents are really interesting,

but remember, your primary goal as an engineer is

to solve problems reliably. Users

probably don't care that you've made a fancy agent. They

really just want a product that's built to work 100% of

the time. So with this in mind, the general

recommendation is to always focus on implementing workflows

where possible and only resort to agents when

they are truly required.
