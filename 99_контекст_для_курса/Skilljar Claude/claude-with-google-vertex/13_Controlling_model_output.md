# Controlling model output

## Transcript

Besides just changing our prompts we send into Claude,

there are two other ways we could strongly influence the output

that we get out of it. So in this video, we're going to discuss two

techniques. One is pre-filling assistant messages,

and second is stop sequences. Let's first

take a look at pre-filling assistant messages. Okay,

let's imagine that we send Claude some kind of really

tough to answer question. Something like is tea or

coffee better at breakfast? I have absolutely

no idea what kind of response Claude would give me. As

a matter of fact, let's go over to our Jupyter notebook really quickly

and see what kind of response we get in the first place. Back

inside of my notebook, I'm creating an empty list of messages.

I'm then going to add in a user message with text

of is tea or coffee better

at breakfast. I then feed in

the list of messages to our chat function, and then I'm going to

print out the answer that we get back. I'm going to

run this. Then, if we take a look at the response,

we'll see that Claude is not taking a strong stance one way

or the other. Instead, Claude is kind of taking a middle

road here and saying, some people like tea and some people like

coffee. Overall, this response is absolutely

okay, but there might be some scenarios where we want to direct

Claude's response in one direction or another. There

might be a scenario where we want to always direct Claude

to favoring tea, or another where we want to direct

it towards favoring coffee. So one way we could do this

is by pre-filling an assistant response.

With message pre-filling, we're still going to assemble a list of

messages. We're going to put our user prompt inside there, but

there's going to be one extra little difference. You

and I are going to manually put on an assistant message

at the very end, and you and I are going to author

the content inside of that assistant message.

And then in Claude, we can kind of imagine this

is what goes on behind the scenes. We can imagine

that Claude is going to see that first message and say

to itself, OK, the user wants to know what I think

about coffee versus tea. It is then going to take a

look at the second message, which is an

assistant message. And because it is an assistant

message, Claude is going to say to itself, oh, it

looks like I already have some thoughts on the situation.

So I better continue my final response.

I'm going to send back using this as a starter.

So Claude is going to essentially use this as the start

of its response. Because Claude

sees the sentence, coffee is better because that's

going to very strongly steer it in the direction of supporting

coffee as being better at breakfast. So

chances are, Claude is going to give us back a final assistant

message that says something like, it has higher

caffeine, which implies talking about coffee.

Now the one very important thing here to distinguish is that

whenever we put in this final assistant message right here, Claude

is going to assume that that is kind of content that has already

been authored, and it's going to continue its response

from the very end of this sentence. So

you would kind of expect Claude to give you back a full

response like this, where it says coffee is better because

it has a higher caffeine, that is not the case.

It's going to continue the response from the very end of

whatever you pre-filled with. So in other words, this

is not really a complete sentence. And if

you want to use this, you're probably going to have to go back and kind of stitch

together that text right there and that text right

there. Okay, this is

when you explain it, something that's kind of hard to understand. But in

practice, it ends up being really easy once you see a demo or

two. So let's just go right out some more code and see

how this actually works. So back over here, if you want to steer

a Claude in the direction of favoring coffee, right after

adding in the user message, we can then add in an assistant

message. Pass in our list of messages,

and we will then put in our pre-fill here. So I

might say something like, coffee is better because,

and that's all we have to do. We are now

adding in two distinct messages to our initial list of messages

and setting those off to Claude. Again, Claude is going to see

the assistant message and assume that it authored this content.

So the rest of the response we're going to get back is

going to be steered towards favoring coffee. Now

let's run this and see what kind of response we get back.

And there we go. So now Claude has distinctly taken the position

of favoring coffee over breakfast, and it justified

the earlier text that we wrote in. It justified

it by saying coffee gives you an energy boost to start the day.

If we wanted to change the direction of Claude towards favoring

tea, we could just change coffee to tea, like

so, rerun it, and now we'll get some justification

on why tea is better. Finally, we could

also steer a Claude towards totally different directions.

So we could change the assistant message to something like neither

is very good because, and now Claude

is going to try to justify neither tea nor coffee being

very good at breakfast. Now that we have seen message pre-filling,

let's take a look at the other topic for this video, which is stop

sequences. Stop sequences are going to force

Claude to stop generating a response as

soon as it generates some particular string that you provide.

So let's imagine that we provide a prompt of count from

1 to 10, and naturally our expectation would

be that we get back 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all the way up to 10.

We could stop the generation early by providing

a stop sequence of the string 5.

Then internally, whenever Claude generates the string

5, it's going to immediately stop the response and

send whatever it has generated already back to

us. Again, let's take a look at a quick example

of this. Back inside of my notebook, I'm going to scroll up and

find our chat function implementation. I'm

going to add in an additional argument to this of stop sequences,

and I'll default it to be an empty list. I'm then

going to update my parameters dictionary to add

in that stop sequences argument. Then I'll

go down to the bottom of my notebook where I will add in a new code

cell. I'm going to again make an empty list

of messages. I'll add a user message to

the list and I'll ask Claude to count from 1

to 10. I'll then feed that

list into the chat function and

print out the answer. So let's run this, and as expected,

we'll probably get back one through 10. Now let's

try to cap the sequence at 5. In

other words, if Claude ever generates the character 5, I want

to immediately stop its response and generate no more text after

that. To do so, I could add in a stop sequences

list right here. Inside of it, I'll put a string containing

5. Then, if I run the cell, I

should see 1, 2, 3, 4, the comma and the space,

and then 5 was generated, but because I provided that as

a stop sequence, the entire generation is going to end right

there, and 5 is not going to be included. If

I wanted to clip off that extra space and comma

right there, I could add in to my stop sequence, comma

space 5, like so. And now if I run this again, I'll

get just 1, 2, 3, 4.
