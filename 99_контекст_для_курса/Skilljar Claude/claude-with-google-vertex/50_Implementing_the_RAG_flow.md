# Implementing the RAG flow

## Transcript

Now that we understand the entire rag flow, we're

going to walk through an example inside of another notebook called

003 VectorDB. So

in this notebook, I've provided a sample implementation

of a vector database. And I've called it Claude

vector index right here. If you want to, feel free to

take a glance at it, but I'll walk through everything you need to

understand about it. Now in this notebook, we're going

to walk through the entire rag flow by implementing five

different steps, the same five steps we just spoke

about in the last video. So let's get to it.

Step number one, I have already opened up the file and

read the text from it, specifically our report.md

file, which should be in the same directory as the notebook.

So in step one, we're going to chunk the text by

section. I've already added in a function

to help with that. So the same chunk by section function we had

previously. So to do our chunking, chunking

process, I'll say chunks is chunk by

section and pass in all that text. And

now just to test things out and make sure I've got everything

working correctly, I'll try printing out chunks

at about two. And

I should see a printout of the table of contents.

And then if I go to three, I should see the

next section down and then the next section

and so on. Then,

on to step two. In step two, we're going to create an embedding

for each chunk. We will call generate embedding,

and pass in all the chunks, and then assign the result to embeddings.

Next up, in step three, we are going to create an instance of the

vector store. Once

the store has been created, we will then loop over all the different pairs

of chunks and embeddings. We're going to zip them

together, and then as we take each pair, we're going to insert

them into the store. We'll do that with a

four embedding and chunk in

zip embeddings and chunks. And

again, for each of those different pairs of embeddings and chunks, we'll

do a store, add, vector, put

the embedding in. And then as the second argument, we'll

put in a dictionary with content of chunk.

Now, I went over this step rather quickly. So let's do a quick aside

and explain why we are looping over all these things, why

we are chunking it, and why we are adding in this extra dictionary

with the content of chunk. As we just discussed,

eventually at some point in time, we're going to reach out to our vector database

and give back a list of all the different related embeddings

to the input. Now, when we get back this list right

here, just getting the number by itself, just

getting the embedding is not really useful to us because

the embedding doesn't really have a lot of meaning to you and

I as developers. What we really care about is the

text associated with that embedding. So usually

whenever you store these different embeddings inside of your vector

database, you're also going to include either the

text from the chunk that the embedding was generated

from, or at least the ID of the chunk, something

to at least point you back to the original chunk

text. So in this case, I'm going to include

the original chunk text along with

each embedding. Again, just so when we do the look up later

on, and I get back the most similar chunks, I've

got the actual text that I'm looking for now onto

step four. So in step four, at some point in time in the future,

a user is going to ask us a question. We need to take that

question and generate an embedding for it. So I'll make a

user embedding by calling

Claude 3.7 Sonnet. And then my

question here is going to be, what did

the software engineering department

do last year. Finally, on just

at five, where we are going to try to find some relevant documents.

So I want to search the store with the embedding and

I want to find the two most relevant chunks. Not

just the most relevant, I want to get the two chunks

that seem to be most relevant to this question right here. So

for that, I'll do a results store.search.

I'm going to pass in the user embedding And

I'm going to pass in another argument here of two because I want to find the

two most relevant chunks. And

then I will print out for

doc and distance in results.

I'm going to print out the distance, a new line, and

then the documents content. And because

each chunk here is really, really large, I'm going

to print out just the first 200 characters. And

then another new line like so. And

I'll run this. And there's our result.

So we get back section two as our best result.

We also see the cosine distance here. So it's

0.71. And the next

closest chunk is at .72, and that was the

methodology section. So these were the two

chunks that were found most relevant for the user query

that we just submitted. All right, so that is our entire

rag workflow. Now all this works, but

there is one or two scenarios where everything doesn't

quite work as expected. So there are still

a couple of improvements we could add into our workflow. And

let's start to discuss those in just a moment.
