# Multi-turn conversations with tools

## Transcript

We've now gone through an example of wiring up one single

tool to Claude. But as a reminder, the goal of this project

is to wire up multiple different tools to Claude. So we want to have three

different tools in total. I want to think about what's going to happen

inside of our code when we wire up three different tools to Claude.

So let's go through a quick example. Let's imagine that

we submit a user message to Claude asking it what

day is 103 days from today. Now

to answer this, Claude needs to use two separate tools. First,

it needs to use Get Current Date Time to find out what the current date is,

and then it needs to use Add duration to date time to add

103 days to that. So here's what's gonna go on

behind the scenes. Initially, Claude is going to immediately

respond back to us with a tool use block asking

us to call Get Current Date Time. We

will call that function, and then respond back to Claude, telling

it what the current date is. After that, Claude

is going to realize that it doesn't quite have enough information

to answer the user's original question. It now needs to take

the current date and add 103 days to it.

So Claude is then going to respond to us with another separate

tool use block asking us to call add

duration to date time. We will call it, and

then pass the response back onto Claude. And now Claude

has enough information to respond to our actual query.

Now here's why I'm showing you this example in particular.

If we are getting our input for our original user

message from an actual user, like an actual person, we

can't always predict exactly what they are going to be asking

of Claude. So a user might ask some wild

query that's going to require multiple different tool calls

in order to actually answer. So when we add tool calling

into our application, we really need to allow for this kind

of situation. Whenever we submit some query to Claude,

we need to assume that Claude might want to use multiple

tools in a row. And whenever Claude responds to us,

we need to take a look at the response and see if

Claude is asking to use a tool. If it isn't, then

we know that we have a final response that we can finally

deliver back to our user. Here's a pseudo code example

of how we might implement this. We could make a function

called something like Run Conversation that would take in an

initial list of messages. then inside of a while

loop, we'll reach out to Claude, get a response back.

We'll then take a look at that response. And if Claude is

not asking for a tool use, then we know that we have

some response we're ready to send back to a user. Otherwise,

if Claude does want to use a tool, we can run the tool, get

the resulting tool, result blocks, add

them into a user message, and then run Claude all

over again, still inside of the while loop. In the

remainder of this video, we are going to spend some time to refactor

our notebook, to build up a function just like this. So

we are going to build out a function like run conversation that's

going to go through the exact same series of operations.

In order to put this function together, however, we are going to have

to do a little bit of work. We're going to have to do a little

bit of a refactor on our add user message

and add assistant message helpers and the chat function

as well. I've put together a list of all the things

that we're going to do inside of our notebook to get ready for defining

this run conversation function. In step

one, we are going to upgrade our add user message and

add assistant message helper functions so that they

can better deal with multiple message blocks.

Remember that whenever we start working with tools, we are

going to get back responses from Claude that might have multiple

different blocks inside them. And at present, our add

user message and add assistant message helper functions are

entirely set up, always assuming that we are always working with

a plain text block and nothing else. So

let's take care of that back inside of our notebook right away. Back over

here, I'm still inside of the exact same notebook we have been working

on. I just deleted a couple of the cells at the bottom that

had some of the example tool calls, just so you can better see

what I'm doing on the screen. All right, so I'm going

to expand the helper function cell. I'm going to

find add user message and add assistant message. So

once again, right now we are assuming that we are always getting back

some piece of text and we are assigning that directly to the content

property. So now we want to allow for a little bit more flexibility

here. So here's how we are going to do it.

At the top of the cell, I'm going to add an import from

Anthropic.types. I will import message.

Then I'm going to rename the second argument right here. Instead

of text, I'm going to call it message. I'm

going to expand this dictionary like

so. And I'm going to update text

to be message.content if

is instance message capital

in message else message.

And then I'm going to repeat the same refactor on add

assistant message as well. So down here,

I'm going to rename that to message. I will

expand the dictionary. And then to save time,

I will copy that statement right there to right

there. All right, so now I'm going to rerun the cell and

I'll show you what this refactor is going to do for us. So

back down here. I'm going to add in a quick

example call like so. So

I'm just asking Claude to print out the current time in our

minute second format. And I'm providing our get current daytime

tool. I'm then going to print out the message or response

we get back. So if I run this, we'll see that we get the usual

message like so. And inside there

is the content property that has both a text block and a tool

use block. So now to very easily add this in

to my message history as a assistant message,

I would call Add Assistant Message

with Messages, and then I can now put in that entire

response, the entire message that I just got back. So

I'll call that and then print out Messages

on the next cell down. And there we go.

I've got my entire message history being built up. Another

way that I could run this is to put in response.content,

like so. This will work just as well. So if I do that, and

then printout messages, I still get the correct thing. And

then, of course, if I want to, I could always put in a plain

string here as well. And

printout messages. and we'll see that yep,

still building up that response history. So now we have a much

more flexible helper function in add

user message and add assistant message. We could put in a

plain string or a list of blocks or an entire

message and it will digitize the thing for us. This is going

to make dealing with a message that has some tool use

blocks inside of it much easier down the line. Onto

step two of our refactor. We are going to update the chat

function to receive a list of tool schemas. And we'll

take that list of schemas and pass it through to the client

messages create function call. In addition,

from the chat function, we are no longer going to return plain

text out of the first block that comes inside

of the assistant message. Instead, we will return the entire

message that we got back from Claude. Once again, this

is because we are now anticipating getting back responses

from Claude that have multiple blocks inside them. And at present,

our chat function is always assuming that we are only

ever getting back one block, just a single text

block and nothing else. So back over here,

here's the chat function. I'm going to add in a tools.

They'll be defaulted to be none. And then we are going to wire

it up in the same way that we did system right here. So we'll say

if there are any tools that were passed in, we

will add that in as the tools parameter. Next

up, I'm going to go down to the return statement. So right

here. As I just mentioned a moment ago, our

chat function is currently set up assuming that we're always going to get

back a single block from Claude, and that the block

is always going to be a text block. That's why we have this code

right here. We are making a really big assumption that we're always

getting back that one single block and it's always going to contain

some text. Because we are now making use of tools,

that is no longer the case. We might

get back a message that has multiple blocks inside it, so

multiple entries inside this content list. One

of them might be a text block, but we don't necessarily

have a guarantee. So rather than always making

this assumption, I'm now going to return the entire

message. This is going to be a little bit less convenient

for us because now if we ever want to get access to the text,

we're going to have to do a little bit more work, but it's definitely a lot

safer because again, this really reflects reality.

Okay, that's that. So

now on that same kind of note, we're going to now

add in a little helper function. We're going to call it text

from message. And the goal here is to take a look

at a message, take a look at all the blocks, find all

the text blocks, and just extract the text from those. So

this is kind of replacing the functionality that we just removed.

It's going to make it a lot easier to extract all the text out

of a given message. So I'm going to add in that

helper function right underneath chat. I'll

call it text from message. It's

going to receive a message. And inside of here,

I'm going to return a new log new line that

is going to join together a comprehension with

block.text. for block in

message.content if block.type

is equal to text. So

this is going to take a look at all the different blocks inside

of a message. And if the block is a text block,

then we're going to just extract the blocks text and

then join all the block text together and return it. So

again, just a helper function to make it a little bit easier

to get all the text out of a particular message.

All right, so we've taken care of most of our refactor. So

now the last step, which we're going to take care of in just a moment, is

add in support for multiple tool calls inside of a

single conversation. So essentially, we need to implement

a function like this. We need to make a function that's

going to take in the list of messages, and then continue calling

Claude until we get back a sign that Claude doesn't

want to call a tool anymore.
