# The text edit tool

## Transcript

As we saw earlier on inside this module, usually

you as developers author all the different tools

that we want to pass off to Claude. But there is one tool

that Claude has access to by default. This

is called the Text Editor tool, and it is built

directly into Claude. This tool gives Claude

a wide variety of abilities related to just

about everything you can do inside of a standard text

editor. So for example, this tool gives Claude

the ability to open up files or directories

and read the contents. It can take a look at specific

ranges of text inside of a file. It can

add or replace text inside of a file. It can make

new files. It can do undo. Essentially,

everything you would do inside of a normal text editor.

So this dramatically expands Claude's abilities and

almost right out of the gate kind of gives Claude

the ability to act as a software engineer. Now,

understanding the text editor tool is just a little

bit confusing, so I want to walk you through a couple of different diagrams

and clarify what this tool does for you and

what you and I have to do to actually make

use of it inside of a project. So the first thing to understand

here is that only the JSON schema part

is actually built into Claude. And let

me clarify what I mean by that. Remember

that when we want to make use of tools, we really have to author

two separate things. First, on the left hand side,

we have to write out that JSON schema spec. This

gets provided off to Claude and tells Claude about some

tool that it can make use of and all the different arguments that

the tool requires. And then on the right-hand side, you

and I had to write out a tool function implementation

to pair up with that JSON schema. These were

actual functions implemented inside of our code

base that would be called at some point in time when

Claude wanted to use our tool. So we really

had to write both sides here. We had to do both the JSON

schema and the tool function implementation.

So when we make use of the text editor tool,

the only thing that is actually kind of provided for us

or built into Claude is the JSON

schema. That's set of instructions that tells Claude

how to make use of this tool. You

have to provide an actual implementation

to handle all of Claude's requests to use the text

editor tool. That does not exist. It is something

that you have to write out inside of our codebase.

So in other words, whenever Claude decides to say,

maybe create a new file, and it sends back a

tool use part to us that says, I want to create

a new file, we have to provide an actual function

that will actually make a new file somewhere on our

hard drive. So using the text editor tool

is not free, so to speak. It requires a little bit

of effort on our side because we have to write out a couple

of different functions. Now, let's go over to

a Jupyter notebook, and we're going to demo the use of this tool

and take a look at how we would write out some of these different

functions. Back over here, I'm inside of a new notebook

called 005 Text Editor Tool. As usual,

you can find this notebook attached to this lecture. Inside

this notebook, there's a lot of the exact same helper code that we've

been working with so far. But if you take a look at the third

cell down, which has a comment at the top of, implementation

of the text editor tool, you're going to see that there is a tremendous

amount of code inside of here. So this is a class

that I put together ahead of time. It contains all the different

functions that are required to use the text editor tool. So

in other words, this class provides this piece of the

puzzle over here. Remember, I just told you a moment ago

that we have to write out some code to handle all of the Claude requests

to use the text editor tool. I wrote out that code

for you inside of this particular class. Inside

of this class, you'll notice that there are some methods, if you scroll down

a little bit, like view, which can be used to view the

contents of a file or a directory. There is also

a string replace function, which will replace a

string inside of a file. There is a function to create

a file and so on. So everything has already been

provided for you inside of this class. I'm going

to collapse this cell. And the next thing I want to point out to

you is the cell with the comment of make the text edit

schema based upon the model version being used. Now, this

is where things get just a little bit confusing. So let me very quickly

show you a diagram to help you understand what's going on here.

Now, I've repeated several times that this text editor

tool schema is already built in the Claude, and we do not have

to include it. That's kind of mostly true,

but also just a little caveat here, just something to make

it slightly confusing. When we make our request

off to Claude, and we want to make use of this text

editor tool, we do need to include a very,

very small schema. So we need to send a lot of a schema

that's going to look like this right here. The exact

type string that we put in here, notice how it has a date, is

going to change depending upon the exact version of Claude

that we are making use of. So inside this function, I

am checking to see if you are making use of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

And if you are, I'm going to return that schema that

has a date of that right there. And if you're making

use of Claude 3.5, it's going to have a slightly different date.

So you are going to have a slightly different date

depending upon the exact model version. When

we send this very small schema off to Claude, it is going to be

automatically expanded into a much, much larger schema.

That looks a little something like this. So Claude

is going to see that we are including this very small

stub schema that has a name of string replace editor.

And it's also going to notice the exact type that we are putting right there.

Then behind the scenes, we can imagine that this very small

schema gets replaced with this much larger one. That

lists out a ton of information to Claude on exactly

how to use the text editor tool. Now

that we have a slightly better idea of what's going on here, I'd like

to give you a quick demonstration of what the text editor tool

can do. Inside of the same directory as my notebook,

I'm going to make a new file called main.py. And

inside there, I'm going to make a very simple function called

greeting. that will print out hi

there, like so. I'll then make sure that I save that file.

I'm then going to go back over to my notebook and down at

the very bottom, I've added in a cell that's going to

add in a empty user message and then send the list messages

into run conversation. I'm going to ask Claude

to open up the main.py file and just

tell me what is inside this file. So I'll ask

Claude to open the ./

main.py file and summarize its

contents. I'll then run that. And

then inside the response, we can see that Claude did,

in fact, get the contents of that file. And it's going to be

a summary of what's going on inside there. If we take a look

at the list of messages, we'll see that we get a tool

use block right here, where Claude is asking to view

the contents of the main.py file. The

code inside of that text editor tool class that

I showed you a moment ago is going to receive that command. It's going

to open up the file automatically, and then send that contents

back over to Claude. We can actually see the contents right

here. Now, at this point, you might be kind of curious why

the text edit tool exists at all. In other words, what does

it really do for us? What functionality does it really offer besides

the obvious fact that it can somehow work with files on the file

system? Well, chances are right now you

are making use of a code editor that has a really

fancy AI assistant built into it. And you can ask

that assistant to refactor files or create files

or do whatever else. It turns out that we can largely

replicate all the functionality of your fancy code

editor by just making use of this text edit tool.

So for example, I'm going to update the prompt that I'm sending

off to Claude. I'm going to ask Claude to open up that file

and write out a function to

calculate pi to the fifth digit.

And then after doing so, I'm going to ask Claude to then

create a ./test.py file

to test your implementation. I'm

going to run this. After the request is complete,

I'm going to scroll down to the list of messages that were exchanged.

So down here, I've got my initial user message, then

our assistant message, in which Claude decides to use the

text edit tool, and specifically, it wants to try to view

a file. We then send back the contents of that file.

Claude then says, OK, great. I know it's inside this file. I'm

now going to try to replace its contents by writing in some

new content. So we can see right here is

the actual implementation of calculating pi.

Then if we go a little bit further down, we respond

and say that we did the update to the file successfully.

Claude is then going to attempt to create the test.py

file and write some text into it, specifically some

test to test out the implementation it just put together. We

can verify that this all happened by taking a look at

the newly updated main.py file. So

we will now see an implementation for calculating pi, and

then an accompanying test.py file as well, where

we've got some tests. So once again, using

this tool, we can very easily approximate a rather

fancy code editor. And you might be thinking,

OK, why don't I just use my code editor? Well, there

are probably going to be some scenarios on some different applications

you might work on, where you might want to edit some files

inside of some file system, or something similar, where

you don't really have access to a native, full-featured

code editor. And this would be a scenario where you would

want to make use of the text edit tool.
