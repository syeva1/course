# Chat exercise

## Transcript

Let's go through a quick exercise just to make sure everything's

making sense so far. In this exercise, we're going to

be building a very small chatbot that is going to run out

of our Jupyter notebook. Here's how it's going to work. Whenever

we run a cell, we're going to prompt the user to enter

in some text using the built-in input function.

We're then going to take whatever the user enters and add it into

a list of messages. We'll then take the list of messages and

pass it off to the API through the use of our chat function

that we just put together. That's going to give us some feedback

from Claude, so some generated text. We're going to take

that generated text and add it into our list of messages. We'll

print that generated text and then we will loop and

go back to step one so that we repeat the entire process

all over again. I'm going to show you how this thing

is intended to work very quickly. So I've already put

a solution together. I've hidden it inside this cell,

and I'm going to run this cell again just so you can see how I intend

for this thing to work. So whenever I run the cell, I'm

going to immediately prompt the user for some inputs using

the built in input function. And I'll show you how to use that in just

a moment in case you're not familiar with it. Then I'm going

to enter in something like what's one plus one.

I should see my message printed right away, and then I should

make use of the chat function to get a response from Claude and

print that up as well. And then I should be prompted once

again to add in some more text. So now I could say something like

add to that answer. And

then I should see that I'm maintaining the history or the context

of my conversation. So I should now get a response back

that says taking the previous answer to and adding to it

should result in four. And again, this should go on

forever until I eventually interrupt the process

by clicking the interrupt button right here and hitting

escape. Now, as I mentioned, if

you're not familiar with the built-in input function, no problem.

I'm going to give you a little hint right now and just make sure that

it's really clear what we want to do. So I'm going to paste in a little bit of

code that you can use as a little template. All

right, so here's the general structure that we want to use.

We want to initialize a starting list

of messages that's going to start off entirely empty. And then we're going

to have a while true loop that is going to run forever. And

then inside the while loop, we're going to ask the user to enter

in some text, making use of the, again, built-in input

function. Whenever the user types into the displayed

input, we'll be assigned to this user input variable. And

then I put some comments in here just to guide you through the steps of what

we need to do. All right, so go ahead and

pause the video right here. I would encourage you to give this exercise

a shot. Otherwise, stick around and we'll go

over a solution right now. So let's get

to it. Let me show you how we could put this together. So

to implement the rest of this, we really just have to follow the different comments

that I put in here. The first thing we're going to do is take

that user input and add it into our list of messages using

the add user message function that we just put together

a moment to go. So I'm going to call add user

message. I'll pass in the list of messages and

my user input. Then

I'm going to call Claude using the built in chat function and

pass in my list of messages. That's going to give

me back some answer. I'm going to take

that answer and add it in as an assistant message

to my list of messages. So add assistant

message. like

so. And then I just need to print out the generated

text. And optionally, I can put in some delimiters

in the form of little dashes. Just make sure that it's clear

to whoever's using this application that it's being generated

by our AI. So I'll print a

dash, dash, dash. And

in between two of those, I'll print out my answer

that I got back. And that's it. So

now to test this out, I'm going to run the cell. And

then I should see some output up here underneath the cell after

I start chatting with Claude. So I'm going to ask Claude what's

one plus one. And I'll get my response

back and two more. And

I should see adding two more to one plus one should give us four.

All right, very good. So there is our very simple implementation

of a looping chatbot.
