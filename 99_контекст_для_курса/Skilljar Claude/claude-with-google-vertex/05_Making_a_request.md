# Making a request

## Transcript

I think we've done enough talking, so it's time for us to actually write out

some code and get our hands dirty. In this video, we're going

to go through three different steps in order to make a request off to

Vertex. Step one, we're going to first create

a notebook and install the Anthropic Python SDK.

This SDK is going to allow us to make a request off to

Vertex. I've already created a notebook

ahead of time, and I would encourage you to do the same so you can follow

along. So for step one up here, we're going to write

out a magic command so we can install the Anthropic SDK.

We're going to do that with a percent, pip install,

and then inside of double quotes, Anthropic,

square brackets, vertex. I'm going

to run that cell. Alright, after

that, we're going to create an API client. From

the Anthropic package that we just installed, I'm going

to import Anthropic Vertex. This

is a special version of the Anthropic client that is designed

to connect specifically to Vertex. I'm

going to create an instance of that. And

whenever we create this instance, we also have to pass in two keyword

arguments. The first will be region. I'm going to put

in global and our project ID.

Now, your project ID is not going to be the same as mine. You will have

to go over to your Google Cloud console and look up your

project ID using the project selector in the

header. For me, my project ID is course

460319. But

again, you're not going to use the same ID as I. After

that, I'm going to specify the specific model version

that I want to use and assign it to a variable just so I don't

have to type this out everywhere repeatedly throughout all the

following notebooks we make inside this course. So

to model, I'm going to assign the specific model version that

I want to run. I'm going to use Claude,

Sonnet, Dash 4, then AtSign,

and 20, 25, 0, 5, 1,

4. Now, before we move

on to step number three, where we are going to make a request, I

want to go over just a little bit of terminology. So

the first thing to understand here is that we are going to access Claude

by using the create function inside the Anthropic

SDK. This function requires three different

keyword arguments, a model, max tokens,

and messages. The model keyword argument is

just going to be the name of the model we want to run. We already

defined that variable ahead of time in our previous cell.

The second required keyword argument is max underscore

tokens. This sets a maximum budget

on a number of tokens that Claude can generate. For

example, if we pass in a max tokens of 1000, if

Claude tries to generate anything longer than that, then

the generation will be automatically stopped, and we will

receive back the first 1000 tokens that were generated.

One thing to note here is that Claude doesn't try to target

your number of max tokens. In other words, Claude

won't try to write a response of 1000 tokens,

it'll just write whatever response it thinks is appropriate.

And as such, you should really view max tokens as being

like a safety mechanism to ensure that you're not

generating too much text. Finally, messages.

And this is the part that I really want to focus on because

messages are going to be a huge focus for us in the coming videos.

To understand what messages are all about, I would like

you to think back to the chat application we discussed a

moment ago. So a user might type

in some question to Claude and then expect to get an answer back.

The messages that we're talking about when we pass these things

into this create function are meant to represent exchanges

like this. There are two types of messages, a

user message and assistant message. User

messages contain text that we want to feed into Claude.

The content inside of a user message is text that either

a user or you and I as developers have

authored. So in other words, a user message will contain

text that has been written by some person.

The second type of message is an assistant message. These

messages contain text that have been produced by a model

and sent back to us. Now, at this point,

I think we have enough knowledge to at least make our

first request. So let's do that and then discuss

messages a little bit more. Back inside of my notebook,

in the very last cell, I'm going to declare a variable of message.

Now we'll come from client messages create.

And I'm going to pass in those different arguments that we just discussed.

So I'll put in a model of model, a max tokens,

and I'll use 1000 here, which I think is definitely a safe

limit, and then a list of input messages. So

inside here, I'm going to put in one single user message,

and it will contain my question or my query that I want to

send off to Claude. To create a user message,

we'll create a dictionary that will have a role

of user, and then a content that will

contain the actual string that we want to send into Claude.

So in this case, I'm going to ask Claude to define quantum computing

with something like what is quantum

computing answer in one sentence.

Then I'm going to run this. We'll take a moment or two

to run because we are actually accessing Claude here. And

then in the next cell down, I'm going to try to print out the message

variable. We'll see what we get. All

right, so inside of here, we can see there's a lot of stuff coming

out, but noticeably, we have a definition

right around here of what quantum computing actually

is. So inside of this message variable that

we got back, our text is kind of deeply nested.

We very often want to get just the text that Claude has generated,

and very often we don't really care about any of these other properties that

are contained inside this thing. So to access

just the generated text, we would write out message.content[0].text

like so. And if I run that cell again, now I'll

see just the generated text and nothing else.
