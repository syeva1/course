# Generating test datasets

## Transcript

Let's get started on building our own custom

prompt evaluation workflow. We're going to be writing

out a prompt and then writing out some code to evaluate how

well it performs. So let's first focus on making

a prompt. The goal of our prompt is to

help users in writing out some code specific

for AWS use cases. So we're

going to allow user to enter in some kind of task that they

need help with. And then we're going to respond with

one of three types of output. We're either going

to output Python, JSON configuration,

or a raw, just plain regular expression.

Those are our three possible outputs.

So we need to make sure that whenever a user asks for us to

complete some kind of task, we give them some output

in one of these three particular outputs without

any other kind of explanation, or header, or footer,

or anything like that. So that's the overall

goal. Now, the first step of our goal is,

of course, to write out a draft prompt. Now, I've kind of already

done that for us on the right-hand side here. I've got V1 of our prompt,

where it just says, please provide a solution to the following task,

and we'll put the user's task in there. Step two

is to assemble a data set. Remember

that a data set is going to contain some number of inputs

that we're going to feed into our prompt, and then we're going to run

our prompt for every combination of prompt and input.

For our particular case, we're going to have an array of JSON

objects, where every object has a task property.

These tasks are going to describe something that we want

to be done by Claude, so we're going to take each of these tasks,

put them into our prompt, and then feed the result into Claude.

Remember that when we make a data set, we can either assemble

it by hand, or we can generate it automatically with

Claude. Now, as a side note, if you're using Claude

for something like this, this would be a really good opportunity

to use a faster model like Haiku. And

that's what we're going to be doing here. Let's go back on to Jupyter,

we're going to open up our notebook, and we're going to write out a little

bit of code that's going to generate a sample data set, like

the one you see on the left-hand side, using Haiku. Back

over here, I've created a new notebook, it has a lot of the same

code that we've been working on throughout the course. So I'm creating a client

inside the top cell and also loading some environment variables, and

I create those same three helper functions that we've been developing.

Then, a little bit lower, I've defined a function called generate

data set. And inside of here, I've put together a rather large

prompt to get us started. Now, I've taken this

notebook and attached it to this lecture. So I would encourage

you to download this notebook and copy the

prompt right here, or just use this notebook directly to save

yourself a whole bunch of typing. This prompt is

going to ask Claude to go ahead and generate some different

test cases for us. Our test cases are going to

be represented by an array of JSON objects, and

each object is going to have a task property that describes the task

to be done. For right now, I'm just asking Claude to

generate three such objects. This is enough

to definitely get us started and make sure that we can actually create a

data set. So now let's add in some code to

this generate dataset function that we are in. It

will actually take this prompt, send off to Claude, get

back a list of tasks, and then parse them as

JSON. To parse the JSON, we're going to

make sure that we use that same prefilling and stop

sequence method. We spoke about a little bit ago. So

let's get to it. Down here inside of the

function, so I'm going to make sure that I do indent in, I

will declare a list of messages. I'll

add a user message, of

that prompt, I'll then add in an assistant

message, and

I'm going to put in backtick, backtick, backtick,

JSON. I'll then call it chat

with our listed messages and some stop sequences.

In this case, our only stop sequence is going to be backtick, backtick,

backtick. And then finally, I will return

JSON.loads, text. OK,

so I'm going to run the cell to make sure that function gets defined,

and we'll test it out down here really quickly. And

then let's print up that data set just to make sure that

we are getting back some realistic looking data. Okay,

there we go. So there's our three different test cases. We

are getting a case in which we are going to get a Python function, write

some JSON configuration, and then write a regular

expression. So let's say this is a good start. Next,

I would like to take this data set and write it into a file. So

we can very easily load it up later on when we start to

evaluate our prompt to do so. We

will open up a file in my right mode. I'm going to

call the file dataset.json. And

then json.dump with

an indent of two. So I'm going to run

this again. After that cell runs inside

the same directory as my notebook, I should find a dataset.json

file and inside there should be our list of tasks.

Okay, this is a good start. We've got our eval

dataset put together.
