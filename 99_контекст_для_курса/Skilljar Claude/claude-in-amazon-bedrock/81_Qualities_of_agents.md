# Qualities of agents

## Transcript

We have now taken a look at two agent type tools authored by Anthropic.

 So let's now spend some time to reflect on how they work and use that

 knowledge

 to better understand what agents are all about.

 First, I want to review Claude code.

 I went back to our small project and gave Claude an additional task.

 I asked it to write out some tasks for a particular corner case.

 Claude then used a series of tools to fulfill the request.

 And I've shown the entire log for this operation on the screen.

 Now, out of all these different tool calls, two were used to read

 existing

 files inside the project, one was used to write to a file, and one

 was used to run a test.

 Now, I'd like to think critically about each of these different tool

 calls

 and what they were meant to achieve.

 In other words, why did Claude decide to use each?

 Well, three out of the four tool calls were really intended to gather

 information

 about the environment.

 By environment here, I really mean the code base that Claude was

 operating on.

 The one remaining call was intended to modify the environment in some

 way.

 We can see a similar pattern with computer use.

 When I asked Claude to test out that mentioner component, Claude

 made a variety of different tool calls.

 Just so you know, the computer use tools automatically return

 screenshots.

 So if Claude attempts to type or move the mouse, it'll immediately

 get

 some visual feedback of the environment.

 So as we examine the tool use of Claude code and computer use, we

 start to

 notice a pattern really quickly.

 Both of them are using tools and these tools are largely focused on

 just

 delivering or getting information into Claude.

 Let's summarize some of this tool use inside of a table and use it to

 better

 understand what agents are all about and what really goes into making

 a

 successful agent.

 So in both Claude code and computer use, we're going to see that they

 share

 a wide variety of different qualities in how they work, how they run

 and how

 they are getting information into Claude.

 Both these make use of tools extensively and they both run tools

 inside of a

 loop until some goal is achieved or until some unrecoverable error

 occurs.

 They both rely upon tool calls as their primary source of information

 about

 the environment, as opposed to relying upon some kind of rag process

 or

 relying upon a developer to write out a super detail prompt or

 relying upon a

 user to write out extensive instructions.

 They're both given a very small, very focused set of tools where each

 tool

 has a very clear purpose.

 Finally, they are both intended to work on high value problems, where

 failure doesn't cost much money.

 In other words, Claude is writing code, which is traditionally a very

 high

 value task.

 It takes a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience to write

 effective code.

 At the same time, if Claude makes a mistake in the code it generates,

 there's not necessarily an immediate, inherent economic or safety

 impact.

 Compare this to Claude, say, building a complex design for a bridge

 where an

 error could have a very large safety impact.

 In summary, when we consider building an agent, there are a few

 concepts we

 need to keep in mind.

 First, an agent is a language model that has access to a set of tools

 and is

 being executed repeatedly until a goal has been achieved.

 Second, context is king.

 Claude doesn't have any knowledge of the outside world at all, and it

 relies entirely upon being given a set of tools to inspect the

 environment.

 Third, we really want to think about using agents only when we have a

 high

 value task, where an error or failure won't have a large economic or

 safety

 impact.

 And finally, the best way to make sure you are building an effective

 agent is

 EVALS, creating some evaluation criteria and evaluating your agent

 against it is

 the only way to ensure that you are making an effective agent.
