# Reranking results

## Transcript

The hybrid based retrieval approach that we have implemented is

working pretty well.

So as we saw at the end of the last video, if we search for what

happened with this incident,

we're going to get first the cybersecurity and then software

engineering.

However, there are still some weak points inside our retrieval

process.

Let me show you an example.

I'm going to update the query here to be, "What did the engineering

team?"

And notice I put in not engineering, but just in abbreviation of ENG.

What do the engineering team do with incident 2023?

So now that I am asking specifically about the engineering team

and the incident, I would kind of expect to see section two pop up a

little bit.

Because remember, section two is about software engineering

and the software engineering team.

And inside of the body of this section, there is mention of this

incident.

So now this query in my mind personally, I think this really is the

most relevant section.

But if I rerun this, we're going to see that we still end up getting

section 10 and then section two.

So it's clear that even though we have added in a lot of complexity,

well, again, still a couple of rough edges.

So in this video, we're going to take a look at yet another technique

that we can add in to improve our retrieval accuracy.

This technique is referred to as re-ranking.

And the idea behind this is super simple.

After going through everything that we just covered in the last video

,

so we're going to still run our vector index and the BM25 index

and merge the results, we're then going to add in another post

processing step,

something called a re-ranker.

The re-ranker is going to take some number of our search results

and pass them off to Claude inside of a prompt.

So here's a sample prompt that we might use for a re-ranker.

We are going to ask Claude to take a look at the user's question,

specifically what happened with incident so and so,

and then we're going to provide all the different documents that we

have currently found

that seem to be somehow related to the user's question.

And then we're going to give Claude a very simple task.

We're going to ask Claude to return the three most relevant.

And it doesn't have to be three, just some number of the most

relevant documents

in order of decreasing relevance.

So in other words, go through all the supposedly relevant documents

and just reorder them or re-rank them

so that the most relevant document is at the top.

So Claude is going to take in the instructions and of course,

it's going to execute the task perfectly and send us back a reorder

list of relevant documents.

To understand how this really works,

let's take a look at a notebook where I have implemented this re-

ranking strategy.

So back over here, I've opened up a new notebook called 006

underscore re-ranking.

There is a ton of setup code inside of here,

and then eventually we get to the implementation of a function called

re-ranker fn.

This function is going to be called automatically by the retriever

after we have ran the initial search process with the vector index

and the bm25 index.

So we've already gotten back the initial results.

We've already merged them and now we're going to take these merge

results

and pass them into this re-ranker function.

So we are going to iterate over all those documents we found.

We're going to print them up in a nicely formatted XML structure.

We're then going to insert that list into a larger prompt, the one

you see right here.

This prompt is asking Claude to take a look at the user's question

and take a look at the documents that we have found already.

We are then going to ask Claude to return a list of documents in

order of decreasing relevance.

So the first documents that we get back should be the most relevant

results.

Then as usual, we're going to go ahead and use a assistant message

pre-fill and a stop sequence

just to ensure that we get back some well formatted JSON.

Remember, we could use tools here to ensure that we get back well-

structured JSON,

but in this case, it would be a lot of extra work just to get some

structured data back.

And I think using this pre-fill with the stop sequence is definitely

appropriate.

Now, before I say anything else, there is something I want to clarify

that might be a little confusing.

You'll notice that in this prompt, I'm referring to some document IDs

all over the place.

But in the diagram, I showed you just a moment ago,

there is no mention of any IDs whatsoever.

So what are these document IDs exactly?

Well, it really comes down to efficiency.

If we use the prompt, I showed you that diagram just a moment ago,

and asked Claude to just give us back the most relevant documents or

text chunks,

we're essentially asking Claude to send us back the full text of

every single text chunk.

This would be extremely inefficient because we would just be sitting

around and waiting for Claude

to copy the text out of each individual chunk.

So a better solution would be to generate some random IDs ahead of

time

and assign them to each document or essentially text chunk.

And then ask Claude to just return those IDs.

This will be significantly more efficient because Claude can return

just a very simple little bit of text

that's going to tell us the exact order of chunks that we should be

making use of.

Well, now that we understand how everything is working,

let's actually run the notebook and see if we get some reasonable

results.

Now, I've already ran all the different cells inside of here.

Make sure you run all the cells as well.

I'll go down a little bit and get down to the very bottom here.

We're going to ask that same question as before.

What happened with incident 2023?

So I'll run that and I'll get back same results we had previously

back when we had the just hybrid approach.

So I got section 10 and then section two, so nothing bad.

But now I'm going to update the query to the one that gave us just a

little bit of trouble

a moment ago with the hybrid approach.

So what did the engineering team do with incident 2023?

And again, my expectation here, my real hope is to see section two

pop up to the top.

There's no guarantee that's going to happen.

You might get different results than I, but that's personally what I

'm going to hope for.

So I'm going to run this and then sure enough, we do in fact get

software engineering popped up to the top.

So that's definitely a good result.

Claude has noticed that the user query here really cared about

specifically the software engineering team

and their relationship to this incident.

While adding in this re-ranker was definitely a success.

On the downside, it increases the latency of our search pipeline

because now we have to wait for a call to Claude to resolve.

But on the plus side, it also without a doubt increases the accuracy

of our search pipeline.
