# Chat bot exercise

## Transcript

Let's go through a very quick exercise just to make sure everything

 is making sense so

 far.

 Our goal inside this exercise is to make a very simple chatbot using

 those three helper

 functions that we just put together a moment to go.

 Now you can read through the different steps that I think you're

 probably going to have

 to implement right here, but to understand the exercise, it might be

 easiest if I just

 give you a quick demonstration of what I would like you to try to

 build.

 So here's what we're going for.

 Inside of a Jupiter notebook, we're going to make a single cell like

 the one I've got

 right here.

 I've got my solution side of here, but I've collapsed it just so you

 can't see it.

 And now if I run the cell, I want to prompt my user to enter in some

 input.

 So for me, that's appearing up here at the top.

 Then I'm going to enter in some string that I want to send off to my

 model.

 In my case, I'm going to enter in write a one sentence product

 description.

 Now, if I hit enter, I'm going to wait just a second, and I should

 then see a response

 right back here.

 And now I should see my input up here once again, and I should be

 able to enter in a follow

 up message, that's going to still contain these previous messages as

 context.

 So I should be able to say something like make it shorter and see a

 response that's going

 to make it clear that we're still talking about a product description

 because we included

 those previous messages, and I definitely do.

 And then I should be able to repeat this as long as I want.

 So maybe I could say something like make it mention a color and I

 could just keep on

 going and going and going.

 Now you should still be able to complete this exercise, even if you

 are running a Jupiter

 notebook outside of VS code.

 So just as a quick demo, if I flip over, I've got this running inside

 of a browser notebook

 as well.

 And so if I run that cell, I can type in my prompt right here.

 So one sentence product description, and I should still see an output

 in the exact

 same way.

 Now this exercise is just a little bit tricky because it is going to

 require a little bit

 of basic knowledge around Python.

 And if you're not super familiar with Python, that's totally fine.

 I'm going to give you a quick hint right here on the general

 structure of the code you're

 going to write to make this work.

 So as a hint, I'm going to put in a little couple of comments right

 here in just a snippet

 or two of code.

 Here we go.

 This is kind of our starting point.

 So just in case you need a little bit of help in first make that

 initial list messages,

 we can then run our chat bot forever by putting in a while true.

 And then to get our user input, we can call the built in input

 function.

 And then I put in some comments for the other steps you'll have to go

 through, and I bet

 you could figure these out based upon the code that we went over in

 the last video around

 adding user messages, calling chat, and then depending on an

 assistant message.

 So I'd encourage you to give this exercise a shot.

 So pause the video right now and go ahead and give it a chance.

 All right, you've unpause, we'll go our solution right away.

 So I'm going to start from the snippet that I gave you just a moment

 to go.

 All we have to do is fill in a couple of lines of code.

 We've already got our initial list of messages.

 We've got a wild true right here to run this thing forever.

 We've collected some user input as text.

 Now all we have to do is fill in some different tasks right here for

 each of these different

 comments.

 For the first one, we're going to take whatever text a user just

 typed in, and we're going

 to add it into our list of messages.

 And for that, we can use the function we put together a moment ago,

 that add user message

 function.

 So I'll call add user message.

 I'll put in the list of messages I want to add to, and then whatever

 the user just typed

 in.

 Then we're going to take that list of messages and send it off to our

 API and save whatever

 text we got back.

 So I'll say our text that we're generating is going to be chat with

 messages.

 So text right here, that is the response we got back.

 That's the generated text.

 So we'll now add that generated text to our list of messages with a

 add assistant message.

 And we should probably also print that up as well.

 Okay, now depending upon whether you are running your notebook in VS

 code or not, there's one

 other thing you might need to do here.

 If you're running in VS code, you are going to want to print out the

 user input.

 So I'm going to print user input right here.

 I'm going to put a little carrot in the space before it just make it

 look like a nice little

 prompt.

 You only have to do this if you are in VS code.

 If you're not in VS code, if you're running your Jupyter notebook

 inside of a browser,

 you're going to automatically see the user input printed out for you.

 So again, only necessary if you're in VS code.

 I also might want to put in some nice formatting around the text

 right here when I print it

 out.

 But that's totally optional.

 Let's just run this to make sure it actually works.

 So I'll run it and then just as we saw previously, I get this nice

 little prompt up here and

 I'll ask for a one sentence product description.

 And I should see my, yep, there we go.

 Very good.

 That's my response.

 On this conversation, add in additional messages over time.

 So I could say shorten it, add a color, and so on.

 Very good.

 Now, if you had any trouble with this exercise at all, don't sweat it.

 .

 This is our first practice with AI, first time kind of taking a look

 at this stuff.

 So we get a lot more practice throughout this course, a lot more

 opportunities to make

 sure that you're super confident on what's going on.
