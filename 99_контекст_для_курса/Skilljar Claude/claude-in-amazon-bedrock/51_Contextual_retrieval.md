# Contextual retrieval

## Transcript

In this video, we're gonna take a look at another technique

 for improving the accuracy of our rag pipeline.

 This technique is known as contextual retrieval.

 The idea here is that whenever we take our original source

 document and split it up into chunks,

 each individual chunk no longer contains context

 of the original document.

 Contextual retrieval aims to fix this

 by adding in a pre-processing step

 before we insert each text chunk into our retriever database.

 So we're going to take each individual chunk

 that we have produced and our original source document

 and place it into this prompt and then send it off to Claude.

 This prompt, as you can read, is gonna ask Claude

 to take a look at this individual text chunk

 and the contents of the overall source document.

 We then ask Claude to write out a little bit of text

 to situate or kind of place or add some context

 to the individual text chunk.

 We're then going to repeat this process

 for each text chunk we have over here on the left-hand side.

 So as an example of the output we might get from this,

 let's imagine that we put in section one,

 software engineering right here,

 which includes a mention to that 2023 incident.

 And there's also a similar mention

 down inside of section two, cybersecurity analysis.

 The added context that Claude might generate

 could look like this.

 Might say something like this is a section

 from a larger report and this section

 includes a mention of this incident

 and that incident is also mentioned in this other section.

 So now we're taking this input chunk

 and adding some additional ties to the larger document.

 Once Claude generates this extra little bit of context,

 we're then going to join together that context

 with this input text into something

 that we're referred to as our contextualized chunk.

 So right here is the extra context that Claude generated

 and out here is the original chunk text.

 We will then use this contextualized chunk

 as the input to our vector index

 and our BM25 index as well.

 Now right away a very common problem

 that you're probably going to run into,

 your original source document right here,

 we're saying that we want to take all the text

 out of that original document

 and put it into a single prompt

 and then send that off to Claude.

 In many cases, this original source document

 might be simply too large to fit into Claude by itself.

 If you're in that scenario,

 don't worry, there's still a way we can make use

 of contextual retrieval.

 If our source document is too large

 to fit into a single prompt, here's what we might do.

 Let's imagine that we are trying

 to contextualize chunk nine down here.

 So this is the one that we really want to feed into Claude

 and ideally we would provide the original source document

 in its entirety.

 But instead we might decide to include some of the chunks

 from the very start of the document.

 So maybe chunks one, two, and three right here.

 And then some of the chunks right before chunk nine.

 The idea here is that the starter chunks

 at the very top of the document provide

 possibly a summary or an abstract

 or something to kind of explain

 what the entire document is about.

 And then the chunks right before chunk nine

 are going to provide some context for chunk nine itself.

 And chunk four, five, and six,

 while they might be important,

 they're probably not going to provide

 quite as much context as all the others

 that we might include for chunk nine.

 So this is how we can significantly

 pair down the amount of text we're going to push into Claude

 to provide this context when trying to contextualize chunk nine.

 Now once again,

 let's take a look at a Jupyter notebook

 to get a better idea of how this stuff works.

 All right, so back over here,

 I've opened up a new notebook called 007_contextual.

 We still have a ton of helper code.

 And then I've added in a new cell

 with a function named add context.

 This function is going to take in a single text chunk

 that we're trying to generate some context for

 and some source text.

 So that would be the text from the original source document.

 We're then going to ask Claude

 to write out some succinct context to kind of place

 or give us a better idea

 of what this particular text chunk is really all about

 in the context of the larger document.

 We're then going to get back our response.

 We're going to add together whatever response we got

 with the original text chunk and return it.

 So I'm going to run that cell

 and I've already ran all the cells above it.

 Now let's test this out really quickly.

 So I'm going to chunk the source document like so.

 I'm going to add in a new cell right here

 and I'm going to call add context with chunks at five

 and the report text.

 And let's see what we get out.

 All right, here's my output.

 Now this might look like a lot,

 but remember this is both the added context,

 which is really just that part right there,

 plus the text from the original chunk.

 So section two software engineering right there.

 So in this case, our added context says,

 this is a chunk of section two from this larger report

 and it is following the methodology

 and it's before financial analysis

 and it is a part of a larger report

 that covers 10 separate research domains.

 So I would say this is some pretty effective context.

 It really gives us a better idea

 of what this individual section is a part of,

 kind of the nature of the surrounding report

 or the surrounding document around it.

 All right, so next up in the next cell down,

 I'm going to still create my two indexes and the retriever.

 And then here's where things start to get interesting.

 So again, if we have a really large source document

 where we can't fit everything into a single prompt,

 we might use this little extra strategy

 where we include just some starter chunks

 and then chunks from right before the chunk

 that we're trying to situate.

 That's what this code right here does.

 I've got some configurable variables right here.

 So we are going to try to take two chunks

 from the very start of the report

 and then two chunks from right before the chunk

 that we are trying to contextualize.

 I've then got some code to make sure

 we don't get any duplicates or anything like that.

 I'm going to get all that context from the report,

 join it together and then pass it off

 to the add context function with the chunk

 that we're currently operating on.

 Once we get back that contextualized chunk,

 we will add it into our retriever.

 So I'm going to run this.

 This will take a while to complete

 because we are generating context

 for every section inside of our report.

 But once it is done, we can then go down and test it out.

 Now in this case, using the same query right here

 of what did the engineering team do with incident 2023,

 we're probably still going to get some really good output

 because we already had good output.

 But you can imagine that by including this extra context,

 if we add a much more complex document

 with individual text chunks or sections

 that have a lot more ties between the overall document,

 well, then I would expect this contextual retrieval technique

 to give me some better accuracy.
