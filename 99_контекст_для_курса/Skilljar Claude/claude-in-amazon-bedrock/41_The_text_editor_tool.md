# The text editor tool

## Transcript

As we saw earlier on inside this module,

 usually, you and I, as developers,

 author all the different tools that we want to pass off to Claude.

 But there is one tool that Claude has access to by default.

 This is called the text editor tool,

 and it is built directly into Claude.

 This tool gives Claude a wide variety of abilities

 related to just about everything you can do inside of a standard text

 editor.

 So for example, this tool gives Claude the ability to open up files

 or

 directories and read the contents. It can take a look at specific

 ranges of text inside of a file.

 It can add or replace text inside of a file. It can make new files.

 It can do undo.

 Essentially, everything you would do inside of a normal text editor.

 So this dramatically expands Claude's abilities and almost right out

 of the gate

 kind of gives Claude the ability to act as a software engineer.

 Now, understanding the text editor tool is just a little bit

 confusing.

 So I want to walk you through a couple of different diagrams and

 clarify

 what this tool does for you and what you and I have to do

 to actually make use of it inside of a project.

 So the first thing to understand here is that only the JSON schema

 part

 is actually built into Claude. And let me clarify what I mean by that.

 Remember that when we want to make use of tools,

 we really have to author two separate things.

 First, on the left-hand side, we have to write out that JSON schema

 spec.

 This gets provided off to Claude and tells Claude about some tool

 that it can make use of

 and all the different arguments that the tool requires.

 And then on the right-hand side, you and I had to write out a tool

 function

 implementation to pair up with that JSON schema.

 These were actual functions implemented inside of our codebase

 that would be called at some point in time when Claude wanted to use

 our tool.

 So we really had to write both sides here.

 We had to do both the JSON schema and the tool function

 implementation.

 So when we make use of the text editor tool,

 the only thing that is actually kind of provided for us or built into

 Claude

 is the JSON schema, that set of instructions that tells Claude how to

 make use of this tool.

 You and I have to provide an actual implementation

 to handle all of Claude's requests to use the text editor tool.

 That does not exist. It is something that you and I have to write out

 inside of our codebase.

 So in other words, whenever Claude decides to say, maybe create a new

 file,

 and it sends back a tool use part to us that says, I want to create a

 new file,

 we have to provide an actual function that will actually make a new

 file somewhere on our hard drive.

 So using the text editor tool is not free, so to speak.

 It requires a little bit of effort on our side,

 because we have to write out a couple of different functions.

 Now, let's go over to a Jupyter notebook,

 and we're going to demo the use of this tool and take a look at

 how we would write out some of these different functions.

 All right, so back inside of my editor, I have opened up a new

 notebook.

 This one is called 005 text editor tool.

 Inside of the first cell, I have some of our usual setup code.

 Now, to use the text editor tool, there is just a little bit of

 tricky setup here.

 Remember, we need to eventually provide the name of some different

 tools that we want to

 allow Claude to use. In order to use the text editor tool, we must

 provide very specific string

 IDs when we make our request off to AWS bedrock.

 So there are different tool names for this text editor,

 depending upon the exact model version you are using.

 So if you are using Claude 3 Sonnet, you want the text editor variable to

 be set to exactly

 that string right there. If you're using Claude 3 Haiku,

 then you're going to comment that line out and uncomment the other

 one.

 If you are using a newer version of Claude than the two that I am

 showing right here,

 that's totally fine. Hopefully, I will be able to update this

 notebook for you.

 Otherwise, you can do a quick search in the AWS bedrock documentation

 to find this new string

 that you should be using here. Now, for me, I'm using Claude 3 Sonnet,

 so I'm going to comment out that one and uncomment that one like so,

 and then I will run the cell.

 In the next cell down are some of the same helper functions we've

 been working with

 throughout this entire course. So stuff like add user message, add

 assistant message.

 I have modified the chat function just a little bit to accept in a

 new text editor keyword.

 So that's going to be the name or that idea of the text editor that

 we're just looking at a moment

 to go. If one is provided, then some extra configuration is included

 inside of a additional

 model request fields inside of the params that we're sending off to

 the converse method.

 In the next cell down, there is a class called text editor tool.

 This class includes all the different methods that are required to

 use the text editor tool.

 So in other words, this class provides this piece of the puzzle over

 here. So remember,

 I just told you usually we have to write out some code to handle all

 of Claude's requests

 to actually use the text editor tool. I wrote out that code for you

 inside of this notebook.

 So there are methods inside this class to do things like, if I scroll

 down a little bit,

 view the contents of a file or a directory. There are methods inside

 of here to

 replace a string inside of a file to create a file and so on. So

 everything has already been

 put together for you inside of this cell. Now, without further ado, I

 would like to give you

 a demonstration of how this tool works. So I'm going to open up my

 folder explorer on the left

 hand side. I'm going to find the directory that my current notebook

 is in. And then inside that

 same directory, I'm going to make a new file called main.py. And

 inside there, I'm going to

 write out a very simple function. I'll say def, hello, and inside

 there, print out, hi there.

 I'm then going to save that file. I'll go back over to my notebook.

 And in the final

 cell down here, I'm going to add in a starting user message. Inside

 of that, I'm going to add

 a prompt of write a one sentence description of the code in the dot

 slash main.py file.

 And I'm going to run the cell. And let's see what kind of response we

 now get out of Claude.

 In this response, it is very clear that it successfully opened up the

 contents of that file

 and read the code that was inside of there. Because it says very

 plainly, I opened up that file.

 And it looks like there is a function called hello, the prints are

 greeting high there.

 Now, to really understand what's going on behind the scenes, I would

 encourage you to read

 the message log down here. So the back and forth between Claude and

 our notebook.

 Let's take a look at a diagram to better understand what is really

 being exchanged here.

 So we send off that initial prompt, Claude asking it to write a one

 sentence description

 of the code inside that file. Claude is then going to immediately

 realize that it needs to

 read the contents of the file. Claude is then going to respond with

 an assistant message that has a

 tool use part with this kind of structure inside of it. So it will be

 a dictionary that has a command

 of view and a path of dot slash main dot pie. The code running inside

 of our notebook is going to

 automatically take that little structure right there and realize that

 Claude wants to view the

 contents of the main dot pie file. So the code inside of our notebook

 is going to use that class

 that I just showed you the text editor tool class and a specific

 method in there called the view

 method to open up that file and read its contents. Once it reads the

 contents, we're then going to

 send back a user message that includes a tool result part that looks

 like this. So it'll have some

 text that includes the exact text out of that file that could sent

 off to Claude. And now Claude

 has everything it needs in order to answer our original prompt, which

 was write a one sentence

 description of the code inside that file. So Claude will then send

 back some follow-up assistant

 message like this with a single text part inside of it. Now we can

 very easily verify this is what

 happens while taking a look at the message log. So right here, there

's the immediate follow-up

 assistant message with the tool use asking for a command of view and

 a path of dot slash main dot

 pie. We then respond with the tool result part that contains the

 contents of that file. And then

 here's the final assistant message that says based upon this file,

 here's what the contents does.

 Now the thing that I really want to focus on here is this command

 structure. So what exactly is

 command? Well, as a part of implementing this function right here to

 implement everything that

 is required by the text editor tool, there are a series of different

 commands that we need to

 be able to respond to. So in total, there are five different commands

 that the text editor tool

 might send back to our application. So again, we need to write out

 code to handle each of these

 different cases. And you can very easily find the code that I wrote

 for that in an earlier cell here
