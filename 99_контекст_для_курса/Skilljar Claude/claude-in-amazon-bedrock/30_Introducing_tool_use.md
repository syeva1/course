# Introducing tool use

## Transcript

In this module we are going to discuss tool use. Tools allow Claude

 to access information from the outside world.

 Understanding tool use can be a little bit challenging, so in this

 video I'm going to give you a really soft introduction.

 We are going to walk through the entire flow of tool use and

 understand what it's all about.

 I want to first begin by giving you an example of where Claude can,

 unfortunately, sometimes hit its limits.

 Remember, by default Claude only has access to information that was

 actually trained on.

 So, in general, it doesn't really have any information about very

 recent current events.

 As an example of this, if we had a user making use of our chatbot,

 ask a question of something like,

 "What's the weather in San Francisco, California right now?" and sent

 that off to Claude,

 we would probably get a response back of something like, "I'm sorry,

 but I don't have access to up-to-date weather information like that."

 To fix this and give the user a better response, we can make use of

 tools.

 Let me show you a diagram that's going to break down tools with

 really simple terminology.

 And then I'll show you another one that's going to give you an

 example of how we would solve this specific weather problem.

 Okay, so here's the entire flow that we're going to eventually

 implement when we start to make use of tools.

 We're going to send off an initial request to Claude.

 We're going to ask a question or maybe give Claude a task.

 And along with that, we're going to include instructions on how

 Claude can get some extra data from the outside world.

 Claude will then take a look at whatever question it was asked or

 whatever task it was given,

 and it might decide that it needs to ask for some extra data.

 So it'll send a response back to us where it asks for some extra data

 and it's going to give us some details on exactly what information it

 needs.

 Then on our server, we are going to run a little bit of code that

 will go and get the information that Claude asked for,

 and then respond with that on a follow-up request back to Claude.

 Now Claude has all the information it needs, in theory, to give us a

 response.

 So it will generate a final response that will be hopefully augmented

 or improved by that extra data.

 Now I'm going to show you the same exact flow, but I'm going to

 customize each of these little steps for this scenario

 where a user asks us for some current weather in a particular

 location.

 So here's what happened.

 We would send an initial query off to Claude, and it would include a

 prompt where the user asks about the weather.

 And inside of that initial request, we're going to include details on

 specifically how to retrieve current weather data.

 Claude would take a look at the prompt and decide, "Hey, to answer

 this question, I need to get some current weather data."

 It sends a response back to us where we would then run some code that

 would reach out to some maybe third-party weather API

 and actually get some live details on what the current weather is for

 a particular location.

 Once we have those details from that outside API, we would then make

 a follow-up request to Claude with that current weather data.

 And now Claude has all the information it needs. It has the original

 prompt along with the up-to-date weather data

 so it can generate a final response and send it back to us.

 Now, this entire process seems really simple. That's fantastic. And

 if it seems really confusing, that's totally fine as well.

 As I mentioned earlier, understanding tool use can be a little bit

 challenging.

 And I think one of the reasons for that is that there's a really big

 disconnect between the order in which things actually occur,

 so like this diagram you see right here, and the actual code that we

 write to implement this process.

 You see, each of these different steps needs to be implemented with

 some actual code that you and I write.

 And it turns out that the way we actually often structure our code

 inside of real projects doesn't quite match this flow.

 So we end up kind of jumping all over the place. We very often start

 off by first writing a tool function

 and then we go up to writing out the JSON schema spec, and then we

 might actually handle the actual tool use part in a tool result,

 and then actually go back and make sure that we include the original

 JSON schema spec with request.

 So very often we end up jumping all around as we implement this stuff

, and that tends to be a big reason on why this ends up being

 complicated.

 So in the coming videos, when we start to implement tool use

 ourselves in a Jupyter notebook,

 I'm going to do my best to come back to this diagram rather

 frequently and make sure it's really clear what piece of the puzzle

 we are currently implementing. All right, so with that in mind, let's

 come back in the next video

 and we're going to start to implement our own tool use pipeline.
