# Parallelizing Claude Code

## Transcript

In this video, we are going to explore

 one of the greatest productivity gains around Claude Code.

 Because Claude is a lightweight process,

 you can easily run multiple copies of it.

 Each instance can then be given a task,

 and the separate instances will then work in parallel.

 This technique allows a single developer

 to command their own team of virtual software engineers.

 So in the remainder of this video,

 I'd like to show you some of the specifics

 of implementing this workflow on a real project.

 The first big challenge to address

 is the fact that two instances of Claude

 might want to work with the same file around the same time.

 They might end up writing conflicting code

 or even invalid code,

 because they're not aware that some other process

 is modifying that same file.

 To solve this, we can make sure

 that each instance gets its own separate workspace.

 Each instance can then work with its own copy

 of your project, make changes,

 and then eventually merge those changes

 back into your primary project workspace.

 A common way of implementing this

 is by using a Git work tree.

 Git work trees are a feature of Git.

 So if your project is already managed by Git,

 you can use work trees immediately.

 Work trees are like an extension

 of Git's built-in branching functionality.

 A work tree allows you to create a total copy

 of your project inside of a new directory

 on your development machine.

 Each work tree corresponds to a separate branch.

 So if we have feature A on the left

 and feature branch B on the right,

 we can easily create two separate folders,

 each of which contain a complete copy of our code base.

 Then we can run separate instances of Claude code

 for each work tree.

 They will each work in their own separate environment

 in total complete isolation.

 Once each copy of Claude code has then finished some feature,

 we can then commit the work for each work tree,

 and then merge them back into our main branch,

 just like we would merge a normal branch.

 Now, this might sound like a really complicated workflow

 that would be very tough to manage,

 but remember, you can delegate an amazing amount of work

 to Claude code, including tasks around Git,

 so we can actually get Claude code itself

 to manage this entire workflow.

 Let me show you how.

 First, we could write out a prompt

 that will ask Claude to create the work tree for us.

 We might ask it to also open up our code editor

 inside of the newly created work tree folder,

 and that's what I'm asking for inside this prompt.

 I'm asking Claude to make a new work tree

 inside of a directory at trees slash feature A.

 I'm then going to ask it to SimLink in some dependencies

 because those are not tracked by Git,

 and so they will not be automatically copied

 into the work tree directory.

 And then I'll ask Claude to also open up my code editor

 inside of that new subdirectory.

 Now, let me show you how this would actually all work.

 So I'm gonna take this exact prompt right here.

 I'm going to run it inside of Claude code.

 Claude will then create the work tree,

 create the SimLink of the virtual environment,

 and then open up a new code editor instance

 inside of this new subproject folder.

 Inside of my original editor window,

 I'll see that there is a new trees directory,

 and inside there is a feature A folder.

 Inside that feature, a folder is a total copy of my project,

 and that copy has been opened up automatically

 inside of this new editor window.

 So inside this new editor window,

 I can launch Claude code

 and ask it to fulfill some task.

 Maybe add in some new feature or write tasks

 or do whatever else I need.

 And now this instance of Claude code

 is running in total isolation.

 Before I ask Claude code to do anything inside of here,

 however, I want to point out

 that this is a really long prompt to remember,

 and it's really tedious to have to copy paste

 all over the place anytime that we would want

 to create a new work tree.

 So we're gonna do a quick side topic here really quickly,

 a little side feature of Claude code

 that makes it really easy to create

 and merge in these separate work trees.

 So we could automate this entire prompt

 by making use of another feature of Claude code,

 support for custom commands.

 You can add in custom slash commands to Claude code

 by creating a markdown file inside of a special directory

 inside of your project.

 The special directory is dot Claude slash commands.

 Inside of a file inside that directory,

 we'll write out our entire prompt,

 and then we can easily run this custom prompt

 anytime we want to.

 Let me show you how we can use this feature

 to easily create a new work tree.

 So inside of my original editor window,

 I'm going to make a new folder called dot Claude.

 Inside there, I'll make another folder called commands.

 And then inside that, I'm gonna make a file

 called how about create work tree dot MD.

 And then inside of that,

 I'm gonna paste the prompt that we saw just a moment ago.

 Now this prompt has a hard coded feature name

 or a hard code branch of feature underscore A.

 And I don't always want to have exactly that string.

 So I'm gonna replace it with a special string

 of dollar sign arguments, all capitals.

 This allows us to inject some additional argument

 when we actually run this custom command.

 So now if I save this file

 and restart Claude code very quickly,

 I can run slash project colon,

 create work tree.

 It's called specifically create work tree

 'cause that is the name of the file

 I create inside that commands directory.

 I'll then put in a space

 and then the name of this new work tree.

 I'm gonna call it feature underscore B this time around.

 So now feature B is gonna be taken

 and substituted in for wherever I had placed dollar sign

 capital arguments.

 So now if I run this,

 I should very quickly see a new work tree created.

 And before long, I've got my new code editor instance.

 So now this one is open inside of work tree

 feature underscore B.

 And I can see that the additional work tree

 has been created inside that tree's directory.

 Now that we've seen how we can create multiple different

 work trees, I want to give you a full demo here.

 I'm going to create four separate work trees.

 Each one is going to be designed

 to complete some different tasks.

 So I'm gonna have four instances of Claude code running.

 The first one is going to add in some tests

 around documents.

 The second one is gonna add in some logging.

 The third one is gonna add in two new tools

 and then the fourth one is gonna add in a subtract tool.

 I'm going to run all these tasks in parallel

 and then I'm going to merge the changes from all them

 back into my main branch.

 So for step number one,

 I'm going to create four separate work trees.

 I now have four separate editor instances,

 one for each feature that I want to implement.

 I will start up Claude code in each

 and give each of them some directions

 on some feature to add in.

 When a work tree is complete,

 I will ask Claude to commit that code.

 Then when they are all complete,

 it is time to merge all these changes

 from these different branches back into my main branch.

 We do not have to do this by hand.

 Instead, we can ask Claude to do it for us.

 So I put together another prompt here,

 which I'm going to wire up

 as an additional custom command inside my project.

 This prompt is asking Claude to go

 into one of our different feature work trees,

 take a look at the most recent commit

 just to understand what was done

 and then attempt to merge those changes

 back into the main branch.

 I'm going to add this prompt in

 as another custom prompt inside my project.

 So inside of Claude commands, I'll make a new file.

 I'll call this one merge work tree, paste that in.

 I'll then restart Claude code.

 I'll then run the merge work tree command

 and I'm going to first ask it to merge

 and how about the document tests branch

 that was just created.

 I can then repeat this process

 for all the other work trees as well.

 When I merge in the subtract feature,

 there will be a merge conflict,

 but Claude is going to automatically resolve

 the conflict for me.

 When everything is merged in,

 I can then ask Claude to clean up

 all these different work trees that have been created.

 And that's it.

 So I've now implemented four separate features

 entirely in parallel through the use of Git work trees.

 This is clearly a really big productivity increase
