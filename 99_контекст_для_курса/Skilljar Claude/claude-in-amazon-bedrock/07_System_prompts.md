# System prompts

## Transcript

Earlier on inside this module, we discussed making a web-based chat

 interface.

 Now, I want to revisit that example with a little twist.

 I want to imagine how we could take that example and turn it into a

 kind of AWS support specialist chatbot.

 So maybe a user would ask a question like, "How do I host a Postgres

 database?"

 Then our answer that we get back should probably satisfy some

 requirements.

 So for example, our response we get back and show to the user should

 probably directly answer the user's question

 and list out some different ways of hosting Postgres on AWS.

 It might even want to guide the user through some of those different

 initial steps.

 And then finally, it might also want to mention some related AWS

 services that the user might be interested in.

 Now, just as much as we want our response to include some content,

 there's also some kinds of content that our response definitely

 should not include.

 So for example, we would not want to see any kind of answer that

 mentions how to host Postgres with a competitor solution.

 We would also not really want to see any kind of answers related to

 questions

 that are not about cloud services in some way.

 So if a user asks, "How do I fix my car?"

 We would probably want our chatbot to very politely refuse to answer

 that question.

 Now, we're going to take a look at two different possible ways of

 implementing a chatbot like this.

 So a user can ask a question and then get back some answers that

 follow some specific requirements.

 Option number one, which is maybe not the best option, but we'll take

 a look at it anyways,

 we could write out a user message that lists all these different

 requirements.

 So inside of a user message, we could say,

 "Make sure that you mention how to host things on AWS."

 And we could also say, "Do not mention how to host services outside

 of AWS."

 And also don't answer questions that are not related to AWS in any

 way.

 Now, using option number one would just be really tedious,

 because we would have to think up of a very comprehensive list of do's

 and don'ts

 that would address every possible different question a user might

 ever ask us.

 So maybe this isn't the best solution here.

 Maybe there's a better way we could handle this.

 With that in mind, let me show you option number two,

 which is going to be a better way of solving this problem.

 In option number two, we're going to provide a system prompt to that

 converse function call.

 A system prompt is going to provide Claude some guidance on exactly how

 to respond.

 And it does so by assigning a role to Claude.

 By role, I mean to say that we're going to essentially tell Claude to

 pretend

 as though it has an actual real life job.

 So in this case, our system prompt might say,

 "You are an AWS cloud support specialist."

 This is going to force Claude to pretend as though it is a real life

 cloud support specialist.

 And it's going to attempt to respond in the same way that a real life

 support specialist would respond.

 So presumably, a real life specialist would never try to answer with

 competitor solutions

 and would probably refuse very politely to answer questions that are

 not related to cloud services.

 By just assigning this system prompt, Claude is going to try to do the

 same thing.

 It's going to try to respond in the same way that a real life support

 specialist would respond.

 Now, the best way to get a hold of system prompts is to write out

 some code.

 So let's go back over to our Jupiter notebooks and get a little bit

 of experience with system prompts.

 So back over here, I have made a new notebook, but it has pretty much

 the same code we had previously.

 So I'm still making a client, a model ID, and then defining those

 three helper functions.

 I've also put together another cell here where I'm just asking a very

 simple question,

 how do I host a Postgres database?

 Now, at this point in time, I do not have any system message hooked

 up whatsoever.

 So if I run this, I'll expect to see a response come back that's kind

 of like a general purpose Claude answer.

 It's going to respond as Claude normally would by giving a really well

 rounded answer.

 And it's not going to fulfill some of our big requirements for our

 chatbot.

 Namely, if I take a look at the response here, it's probably going to

 end up mentioning some competitors,

 which is not really what we want.

 So one way that we could fix this up is by adding in that system

 message.

 For right now, I'm just going to hard code a system message in.

 And I'll show you how to make this chat function a little bit more

 reusable after that.

 So first, inside the chat function, I'm going to add a system prompt

 right here.

 And I'm going to copy, paste, and a system prompt just to save a

 little bit of time.

 It's just the same thing you saw on that diagram a moment ago.

 So it just says you are a cloud support specialist, and you just have

 to answer questions related to cloud hosting.

 Then to pass this into the converse call, we're going to add in a

 system keyword right here.

 It's going to be a list with a dictionary that has text of that

 system prompt, like so.

 So now I'm going to rerun that cell to redefine the chat function.

 And then I'll try to rerun my conversation right here and we'll see

 how the response gets updated.

 Hopefully, it's going to respond with some AWS particular Postgres

 solutions and not mention any competitors.

 And so that ends up being exactly what we see here.

 We're going to see the different managed solutions, some self-managed

 options, and then some initial setup.

 And then, notably, it's not going to mention anything about any

 competitors or anything like that.

 Likewise, we can also try updating our query to something that is not

 at all about cloud hosting.

 Now, this doesn't always work, but it usually does.

 So I'm going to try to ask something like give me a bread recipe.

 And we'll see what kind of response we get now.

 So naturally, without the system prompt, we'd expect to get back an

 actual recipe.

 But with a system prompt, we get that very polite refusal.

 Says, OK, I understand what you're going for, but I'm really all

 about AWS cloud support.

 So if you have any questions about that, I can help.

 But otherwise, maybe I can't really answer your question about bread.

 Let's go back up to that chat function.

 As I mentioned, I would like to refactor this thing and make it a

 little bit easier to pass in the system prompt

 rather than always having it be hard coded as it currently is.

 Just so you know, if we pass in this system keyword right here, we

 are required to put in a system prompt

 that has at least one character inside of it.

 So if we try to put in an empty string, like so, and then I run this

 cell and the next one down,

 I'll end up getting a big error message.

 It's going to tell me that I provided a system prompt of length zero

 and must have at least one character inside of it.

 So to refactor this thing and just make it a little bit easier for us

 to specify that system prompt,

 I'm going to copy paste a little bit of code in here just to save us

 some time.

 I'm going to replace the chat function like so.

 So now I'm going to expect to receive a system prompt by default.

 It will be none.

 I then make my params object ahead of time.

 And then if a system prompt is passed in, I'm going to add that in to

 the system keyword,

 and I'll pass all those params into the converse function.

 So now as a quick demonstration of how we can use this updated chat

 function,

 I'm going to rerun that cell.

 I'm going to go down here.

 And now when I called chat, I can pass in a system of you are a AWS

 support specialist.

 And of course, we could really flesh that out.

 But for right now, let's try it with that and make sure we still get

 some appropriate output here.

 Namely, should not really give any good output for still the give me

 a bread recipe.

 And it looks like, yep, we definitely get back some good output.
