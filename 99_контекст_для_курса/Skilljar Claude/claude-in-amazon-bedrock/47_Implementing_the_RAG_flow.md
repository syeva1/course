# Implementing the RAG flow

## Transcript

Now that we understand the entire rag flow, we're going to walk

 through an example inside

 of another notebook called 003 vector DB.

 So in this notebook, I've provided a sample implementation of a

 vector database, and I've

 called it class vector index right here.

 If you want to, feel free to take a glance at it, but I'll walk

 through everything you

 need to understand about it.

 Now, in this notebook, we're going to walk through the entire rag

 flow by implementing

 five different steps, the same five steps we just spoke about in the

 last video.

 So let's get to it.

 Step number one, I have already opened up the file and read the text

 from it specifically

 our report.MD file, which should be in the same directory as this

 notebook.

 So in step one, we're going to chunk the text by section.

 I've already added in a function to help with that.

 So the same chunk by section function we had previously.

 So to do our chunking process, I'll say chunks is chunk by section

 and pass in all that text.

 And now just to test things out and make sure I've got everything

 working correctly, I'll

 try printing out chunks at about two, and I should see a printout of

 the table of contents.

 And then if I go to three, I should see the next section down and

 then the next section

 and so on.

 Next up, let's take care of step two.

 So in step two, we're going to loop through all the different chunks

 that we just created

 and generate an embedding for each one.

 So for that, I'll say embeddings is generate embedding and I'll pass

 in the chunk for chunk

 in chunks.

 We already saw the generate embedding function a moment ago.

 All that function is going to do is take in a little bit of text and

 generate embedding

 for it.

 So if I run this, it's going to take a little bit to actually execute

 because we are making

 a API request for each chunk of text.

 And if I wanted to, I could of course also print out embeddings at

 zero just to verify

 that yes, we did in fact get the embeddings.

 Yep, there they are right there.

 Now in step three, we're going to create our vector store and store

 all these different

 embeddings inside of it.

 So I'm going to make an instance of the vector index, like so.

 And that I'm going to loop through all the embeddings that we just

 created and add each

 them one by one to this store.

 So we'll say for embedding and chunk, and I'm going to zip together

 embeddings and chunks.

 And then for each those, I'm going to add a vector of the embedding

 and then a dictionary

 with content of chunk.

 So let me explain why I'm doing this exactly.

 Why are we doing the zip operation, why are we including this extra

 dictionary on here?

 As we just discussed, eventually at some point in time, we're going

 to reach out to our vector

 database and give back a list of all the different related embeddings

 to the input.

 Now when we get back this list right here, just getting the number by

 itself, just getting

 the embedding is not really useful to us because the embedding, it

 doesn't really have a lot

 of meaning to you and I as developers.

 What we really care about is the text associated with that embedding.

 So usually whenever you store these different embeddings inside of

 your vector database,

 you're also going to include either the text from the chunk that the

 embedding was generated

 from, or at least the ID of the chunk.

 Something to at least point you back to the original chunk text.

 So in this case, I'm going to include the original chunk text along

 with each embedding.

 Again, just so when we do the lookup later on, and I get back the

 most similar chunks,

 I've got the actual text that I'm looking for.

 All right, I'm going to run that and it should take just a moment.

 And now step four, so this will be some time later, eventually a user

 is going to ask a

 question.

 So now we want to generate an embedding for it.

 So we'll say user embedding will be generate embedding.

 And my question here, I'm going to pass in as a plain string.

 I'll say something like, what did the software engineering dept do last

 year?

 So run that get the embedding.

 And now finally, here's what we go and find our relevant documents.

 So I want to search the store with the embedding.

 And I want to find the two most relevant chunks, not just the most

 relevant.

 I want to get the two chunks that seem to be most relevant to this

 question right here.

 So for that, I'll do a results store dot search, I'm going to pass in

 the user embedding.

 And I'm going to pass in another argument here of two, because I want

 to find the two

 most relevant chunks.

 And then I will print out for doc and distance in results, I'm going

 to print out the distance,

 a new line, and then the documents content, and because each chunk

 here is really, really

 large, I'm going to print out just the first 200 characters, and then

 another new line

 like so.

 And I'll run this, and there's our result.

 So we get back section two as our best result.

 We also see the cosine distance here.

 So it's 0.71.

 And the next closest chunk is at 0.72, and that was the methodology

 section.

 So these were the two chunks that were found most relevant for the

 user query that we just

 submitted.

 All right, so that is our entire rag workflow.

 Now all this works, but there is one or two scenarios where

 everything doesn't quite work

 as expected.

 So there are still a couple of improvements that we could add into

 our workflow, and

 let's start to discuss those in just a moment.
