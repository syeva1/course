# Implementing a client

## Transcript

Now that our server is in a good place, we're going to shift gears a

 little bit and start

 working on our MCP client.

 The client can be found inside the MCP client, the .py file inside

 the root project directory.

 Now before we do anything inside this file, I just want to give you a

 very quick reminder

 here.

 Remember what I told you about earlier.

 Usually in a typical project, we are either making use of a client or

 we are implementing

 a server.

 It's just in this one particular project that we are working on that

 we are doing both.

 Again, just you can see both sides of the puzzle.

 The MCP client itself inside of this file is consisting of a single

 class.

 You'll notice there is a lot of code inside of here and it doesn't

 look quite as pretty

 as some of the code we just wrote out inside of the server.

 Let me tell you exactly what's going on inside this file and exactly

 why it is so large.

 Okay.

 So inside this file, we are making the MCP client class.

 This class is going to wrap up something called a client session.

 The client session is the actual connection to our MCP server.

 This client session is a part of the MCP Python SDK.

 So again, this session is what gives us this connection to the

 outside server.

 The session itself requires a little bit of resource cleanup.

 In other words, whenever we close down our program or decide that we

 don't need the

 server anymore, we have to go through a little bit of a cleanup

 process.

 And I have already written out a lot of that cleanup code inside of

 the MCP client class.

 So that's really why this class exists at all.

 Just to make that cleanup a little bit easier.

 You can see some of that cleanup code inside the connect function and

 down a little bit

 lower at the cleanup, async enter and async exit functions as well.

 So it's very common practice to not just make use of this client

 session directly.

 Instead, very common to a rapid up inside of a larger class that's

 going to manage some

 of this different resource stuff for you.

 The next thing I want to clarify is why this client exists at all.

 So in other words, what is the client really doing for us here?

 Well, remember this full that we looked at a little bit ago.

 So we had our code right here and at certain points in time, we

 needed, say, a list of

 tools to send off to Claude.

 And then later on after that, we also needed to run a tool that was

 requested by Claude.

 In order to reach out to our MCP server and get this list of tools or

 to run a tool,

 that's where we are making use of the MCP client.

 So we can imagine that this client is exposing some functionality

 that belongs to the server

 to the rest of our code base.

 So inside of our code base, inside this project, specifically inside

 of the core directory,

 there is a lot of code already inside there that I put together that

 is making use of

 this class.

 So there's some other code that's going to call some of the different

 functions you see

 inside of here, like list tools, call tool, list prompts, get prompt

 and so on.

 For right now in this video, we're going to focus on implementing two

 functions, list

 tools and call tool.

 So as you just saw in the diagram, we looked at a moment ago, these

 two functions are going

 to be used in different parts of our code base to get a list of tools

 to provide off

 to Claude, and eventually call a tool whenever Claude requests to

 call a tool.

 Implementing these two functions is going to be really simple and

 straightforward.

 So let me show you how we're going to do it.

 We'll first begin with list tools.

 I'm going to remove the to do inside there and replace it with result

 is await self dot

 session.

 I'm going to call that like a function list underscore tools.

 And then I will return result dot tools.

 And that's it.

 So this is going to get access to our session, which is our actual

 connection to the MCP server.

 It's going to call a built-in function to get a definition or a list

 of all the different

 tools that are implemented by that server, I'm going to get back

 result and then just

 return the tools and that's it.

 Then we can implement call tool right here in a very similar fashion.

 So this will be return await self dot session, call tool, tool name

 and tool input.

 Once again, getting access to the session, that is our connection to

 the server.

 And I'm going to attempt to call a very specific tool.

 The name, the tool will be passed in along with the input parameters

 or input arguments

 to it that were provided by Claude.

 Now at this point in time, I would like to test out these two

 functions really quickly.

 To do so, we're going to go down to the bottom of this file where I

 put together a very small

 testing harness for us.

 So down here, you'll notice I put together this testing block.

 So we can run this MCP client.py file directly.

 And if we do so, we're going to form a connection to our MCP server

 and then we can just run

 some commands against it and just see what we get back.

 Notice that in your version of the code, there's a comment in there

 about changing the command

 in ARGS right here in case you are not making use of UV.

 So if you're not using UV, make sure you take a look at that comment.

 Inside of this with block, I'm going to add in a little bit of

 testing code.

 So I'll say result is await underscore client list tools.

 And then I'm going to just print out the result that we get back.

 So this should start up a copy of our MCP server, then attempt to get

 a list of all the different

 tools that are defined by it and then just print out the result.

 To test this out, I will flip back over to my terminal and do a UV

 run MCP underscore

 client.py.

 And as usual, if you are not making use of UV, you'll just do a

 Python MCP client.py.

 Okay, so I'll run that.

 And there is our list of tool definitions.

 So I can see inside of here that I have the read it doc contents tool

, which we put together

 a little bit ago, and our edit document tool as well.

 Each one has a description and a input schema as well.

 So this is our tool definition, which will eventually be passed off

 to Claude.

 Now there's one very small gotcha here that you're probably going to

 run into when you

 start working on your own project.

 When you take a look at input schema, you might notice that the

 structure of it, if you've

 got a really careful eye, it doesn't really look exactly like what a

 bedrock Jason schema

 is expected to look like.

 In other words, the structure here is just a little bit different.

 So again, this is a gotcha.

 It's some little bit of a trap that you just need to be aware of.

 The MCP spec has its own definition of what a tool looks like.

 And that is slightly different than what bedrock considers a tool

 definition to look like.

 So somewhere inside of our code, we really have to take this tool

 definition right here

 and convert it into the exact structure that is expected by bedrock.

 I have already written out the code to do that for us.

 So back inside of our editor, if you open up the core directory and

 then bedrock.py inside

 of here, this is all of our code related to running bedrock and

 communicating with messages

 and so on.

 And if you scroll down towards the bottom, you will notice that there

 is a function

 side here called two bedrock tools.

 So this will take in that list of tools that we just saw printed out.

 And then for each tool, it's going to convert it into the structure

 that is expected by

 bedrock.

 Once again, this is just a little bit of a gotcha.

 Just something you need to be aware of.

 This conversion process is already being done automatically somewhere

 else in the code

 based for us.

 So we don't have to worry about calling to bedrock tools inside of

 the code that you and

 I are writing right now.

 I just want you to be aware that yes, we do have to go through this

 little bit of a translation

 step.

 Now, before we move on, there's one other thing I want to test.

 Remember, we just implemented the function that's going to allow us

 to list out some

 tools and pass them off to Claude and the function that's going to

 allow us to call

 a tool that is implemented by the MCP server and then pass the result

 off to Claude as

 well.

 I've already implemented the code that is going to call list tools

 and call tool for

 us somewhere else inside this project.

 So now that we have added in this functionality, now that we have

 defined these tools and the

 ability to call a particular tool, we can now run our CLI again and

 attempt to get Claude

 to make use of these tools.

 In other words, we can ask Claude to inspect the contents of some

 particular document and

 even edit a document.

 So let me show you how we do that.
