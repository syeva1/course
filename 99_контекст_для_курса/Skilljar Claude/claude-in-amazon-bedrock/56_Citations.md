Now that we've got a simple example of Claude's PDF reading

ability, let me show you one additional feature that's

going to give you a better understanding of why giving

Claude PDF is really useful. You

see a common problem around consuming information

from a PDF is that users often have to

take it on faith that the model is correctly interpreting

the contents of the document. Now, Claude has

a feature known as citations that directly addresses

this issue. So let me show you how it works. We're

going to first go through just a little bit of setup.

So the first thing I want to do is open up our earth.pdf

document again. I'm going to go down to the very bottom

page. And the last page here, you'll

notice is all about the formation of the earth. So

the formation of the earth itself and its atmosphere.

Next, I'm going to go back over to my editor. I'm going to update the text

on sending off to Claude. I'm going to change my query to how

earth's atmosphere and oceans formed. Then

on the document dictionary, I'm going to add in an additional field

of citations enabled

true. And finally,

down at the very bottom, rather than just printing out the response

text, I'm going to print out the entire response. I'm

going to run this, and let's see what we get back. The response

we get back is going to have many different parts inside of it. The

first part that we see is one that we've seen many times before. It

is a text part that contains plain text.

But after that, we get a part that we haven't seen

previously called citations content. Let

me help you understand what this new part is all about. The

best way to understand this is to look at a quick demonstration.

So I took that response you saw inside of my editor just a moment ago,

and I reformatted it using Claude into this

nicely formatted document. All the plain text

you see in here is all coming from the different text

parts inside the response I just got back. But

in addition, you'll also have little numbers scattered

throughout. These are serving as citations, and

they are represented inside the response by those citation

parts we just saw. If I mouse over one, I'll

get some information about why Claude decided to make

this statement. So specifically, why it decided

to say that statement right there. In short,

Claude is citing a source and telling us exactly

where from the source PDF, it is pulling the information

that is supporting that statement. So in this case, Claude

is saying that it looked into the earth.pdf file. and

on page four in particular, it found

some text to support this statement.

We have many different citations inside of this example, so

in my case I got seven in total. The reason

that this citations feature is so useful is that it gives

your users confidence in the answers that Claude is generating.

If a user wants to, they can go back to the source PDF

and verify the information that led Claude to making

particular statements.
