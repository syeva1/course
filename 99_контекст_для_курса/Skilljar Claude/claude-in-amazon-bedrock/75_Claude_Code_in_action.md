# Claude Code in action

## Transcript

To get you some hands-on experience with Claude Code,

 I created a small project for us to work on.

 You should find the source for this project in

 a zip file attached to this lecture.

 I would encourage you to download this zip,

 extract its contents, and then start up

 your code editor inside of this new project directory.

 I've already opened up the project inside of my editor.

 Once you have the project open,

 you might be tempted to look through the project contents,

 and maybe go through a little bit of setup,

 which is described inside the readme file.

 But before you do, there's something important I would

 like you to understand about Claude Code.

 Claude Code is not a tool that is just going to write code for you.

 Naturally, it absolutely can,

 but that's not the only thing that Claude Code is about.

 Instead, you really want to view Claude Code as

 another engineer who's working on this project alongside you.

 Every task that you would normally go through on a normal project

 can really be fully delegated off to Claude.

 So this includes everything from initially setting up a project,

 to designing new features, to deployment, and to support.

 As we go through this project,

 we're going to leverage Claude heavily to aid us in various steps.

 We will use Claude to set up the project for us,

 to plan out a new feature, to write tests and code,

 and then later on, on a slightly different project,

 I'll show you how we can use Claude Code to automatically discover

 and fix errors in a production environment.

 So let's get to it.

 Back inside my editor, I'm going to open up my terminal,

 and then launch Claude Code inside there by executing Claude.

 Then, once I have this open,

 I'm going to put in my first directive to Claude.

 I'm going to ask it to read the contents of the README file,

 and go through any setup directions that are listed inside of here.

 I will ask Claude to read the contents of the README file

 and execute these setup directions listed in it.

 Claude will then use a variety of different tools to read that file

 and then execute a series of different commands.

 It will create a new virtual environment,

 activate the environment, and then install some dependencies.

 Once that is complete, we are going to run a command

 that will help Claude get a better understanding of our project.

 We're going to do so by running the init command.

 This is a command that we're going to execute inside of Claude Code

 itself.

 When you execute this command,

 Claude will automatically scan your code base

 to understand your project's general architecture,

 coding style, and so on.

 Once complete, Claude will write all of its findings

 into a special file named Claude.md.

 Whenever we run Claude again in the future,

 this file will be automatically included as context.

 Just so you know, there are three different Claude files.

 Project, local, and user.

 We're going to see some references to these in a minute,

 so we'll discuss what they're all about then.

 Whenever you run this init command,

 you can also optionally add in some special directions

 for some areas for Claude to focus on.

 So let's try this out right now

 and see what is generated for our project.

 I'm going to run the init command,

 and when I do, I'm going to pass in some special instructions.

 I'm going to ask Claude to include some detailed notes

 on defining MCP tools.

 Once it is all done, I'm going to take a look

 at the newly generated Claude.md file.

 So this is a summary of what Claude thinks of our code base.

 At the top, it will list out some important commands

 that it might need to run in the future.

 We'll get some listing around our coding style

 that we've used inside this project,

 and then as I specially requested,

 it also included some information

 around defining MCP tools.

 As I mentioned a moment ago,

 this file is going to be included as context for Claude

 in any follow-up request we make in the future.

 Now, projects change over time.

 We might change our coding style

 or add in some additional commands.

 So if that ever happens,

 we can very easily manually edit this file,

 or we can choose to rerun the init command.

 If you rerun this command,

 Claude will update the contents of the Claude.md file.

 Finally, as a very small shortcut,

 we can put in a pound and then type in some specific note

 that we want to be appended into the contents of that file.

 So we can use this as a tool

 to give very specific small directions to Claude

 that will be included in all follow-up requests.

 So for me, I might add in a direction here

 that says something like always apply appropriate types

 to function arcs.

 If I run that, I'll then be asked

 where I want to add this little note.

 This is where we see that project memory,

 local memory, and user memory appear.

 In my case, this is a note that I want to be shared

 with everyone who is working on this project,

 so I will add it to project memory.

 Once I add that in,

 I can then check the contents of my Claude.md file,

 and either somewhere under a code style

 or perhaps at the very bottom,

 I'll probably see whatever note I just added in.

 At this point, we have added a new file to our project,

 and this project is being managed by Git.

 So normally, we would open up our terminal,

 stage this new file that we just created into Git

 and then commit those changes.

 We could do all that manually,

 but it'd be a lot faster

 if we just ask Claude to do it for us.

 So I'll ask Claude to stage and commit all changes.

 Claude will then take a look at all the different changes

 we have made to the code base,

 write a descriptive commit message,

 and commit those files.

 Next up, I would like to show you some techniques

 for increasing Claude's effectiveness when writing code.

 We are going to add a new feature into this project.

 As a reminder, this project is a very small,

 very simple MCP server.

 We are going to ask Claude to add in a new tool to the server

 that will read a Word document or a PDF file

 and convert the contents to Markdown.

 Now, we absolutely could just type in directions

 for that to Claude, something like make a Word doc plus PDF file

 to Markdown conversion tool.

 But before doing that,

 I want you to know that we can dramatically increase

 the effectiveness of Claude by putting in

 a little bit more effort.

 So let me show you how.

 Think of Claude code as being an effort multiplier.

 If you put a little effort into how you direct Claude,

 you will get back significantly better results.

 I'm going to show you two different workflows,

 two different ways of instructing Claude

 on how to approach a task.

 Both of these workflows require a little bit

 of effort on your side,

 but they allow Claude to tackle much more complex problems.

 In this first workflow,

 we're going to go through three distinct steps.

 First, we're going to identify some areas of our code base

 that we know are relevant to a feature

 that we are trying to work on.

 We're then going to ask Claude

 to specifically read and analyze those files.

 Second, we're going to tell Claude about the feature

 we want to build and ask it to plan out a solution.

 So the steps will actually go through to implement

 whatever feature or problem you're trying to solve.

 And then finally, after Claude has gone through that planning step,

 we will ask Claude to actually implement these solution.

 Let me show you how we would do this

 for our particular feature

 of adding in some new document conversion tool.

 So first, I'm going to go through my code base

 and identify some different relevant files.

 You'll notice there is a tools directory

 and inside there is a math.py file.

 This is an example of a tool

 that has already been put together.

 So this might be some file that is relevant

 for the feature that we are trying to build

 just because it gives Claude a better idea

 of how to author a tool.

 Second, we might ask Claude to take a look

 at the document.py file,

 which includes a very helpful function,

 binary document to markdown.

 So this will take in some amount of binary data

 and convert it to markdown.

 So we can tell Claude to take a look at these files

 and Claude will get a better idea

 of how to write a tool in the first place

 and then how to actually do the conversion.

 So I'm going to add in some instructions to Claude

 and ask it to just read the contents of those files.

 Next, I'm going to ask Claude to plan out the implementation

 of a new tool called document path to markdown,

 which will take in a path to a PDF or Word document,

 read the file, convert the contents to markdown

 and return the result.

 I'm also going to tell Claude specifically

 to just plan the feature out

 and not to write any code just yet.

 In response, Claude is going to give us

 a pretty well detailed plan

 that's going to go through a couple of different steps

 that will be required to implement this entire thing.

 Finally, I
