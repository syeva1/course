# Prompt evaluation

## Transcript

Now that we understand how to access Claude, we're going to shift our

 focus a little bit

 and look at two new topics, prompt engineering and prompt evaluation.

 These two topics are all about making sure that we are writing

 prompts that will get

 us the best possible output from Claude.

 Prompt engineering is a series of techniques that will use any time

 that we want to write

 or edit a prompt.

 These techniques will aid Claude in understanding what we're asking

 of it and how we want it

 to respond.

 Prompt evaluation, on the other hand, is where we do some automated

 testing of a prompt,

 with a goal of getting some kind of objective metric that tells us if

 our prompt is effective

 or not.

 In this section, we're going to be mostly focused on prompt

 evaluation.

 After we understand how to measure the effectiveness of a prompt, we

'll then take a look at some

 prompt engineering techniques, so let's get to it.

 The first thing I want to do is help you understand where prompt

 evaluation fits in to the prompt

 writing process in general.

 After you first write a prompt, you generally have three different

 paths ahead of you, three

 different ways you can go from there.

 With option number one, you might take that prompt you put together,

 maybe test it once

 or twice and decide it is good enough to use in production.

 With option number two, you might test the prompt a couple of times

 with your own custom

 inputs and maybe tweak it a little bit to handle a corner case or two

 that you notice.

 Now right away, I want you to understand that options number one and

 number two are kind

 of traps that all engineers fall into, myself included.

 It happens to everybody.

 We all start writing out prompts that are going to eventually be used

 in serious applications

 and we don't really test them enough to make sure that they are

 working as expected.

 So whenever you write a prompt, I highly recommend going with option

 number three.

 Run your prompt through an evaluation pipeline to get an objective

 score that will tell you

 how well your prompt is performing.

 You can then try to iterate on your prompt a little bit and make sure

 that it's performing

 as well as it possibly can.
