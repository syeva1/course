# System prompt exercise

## Transcript

Let's try going through an exercise around system prompts very

quickly.

So in this exercise, I'd like you to write out some code like what

you see right here.

I've created a list of messages and I added in a user message of

right a function

that checks a string for duplicate characters.

I then get some text out of that and then print the text out.

Now, with this starting prompt, I end up getting a lot of output back.

.

So here's the result that I personally got.

You can see that there is a little bit of preamble up here.

I kind of explained the solution and there's a ton of comments inside

the code.

And then finally, some closing statements around the code that was

written.

Now, this is a lot of response here for a rather simple function.

So I want to somehow get a much more concise answer.

One way that we can get a more concise answer will be to adjust the

user

message and add in a ton of different requirements.

So for example, in the user message, we could say, do not add in any

comments or

anything like that, respond just with some code, et cetera.

Or alternatively, a better way we could get a more concise answer

would be to add

in a very short system prompt that assigns a role to Claude.

So in this exercise, I would like you to take the code you see right

here and then

just add in a system prompt to the chat function and see if you can

get a result

back that has none of the header text or the footer, no comments or

anything like

that, besides maybe a general function comment, like the one right

here, that's

totally fine. But other than that, I want really just the code and

nothing else.

So I would encourage you to pause this video right now and go ahead

and give

this exercise a shot.

Otherwise, if you want to stick around, I'm going to go through a

solution right

away. So here's how you would solve this problem.

Now I'm going to add in a system prompt to our chat function call.

And in this case, I'm going to put in a system prompt, something

really simple,

a role that kind of implies to Claude that it should write some very

concise code.

So I'm going to put in a system prompt of you are a Python engineer

who writes

very concise code.

And that's probably going to be enough to get all those extra

comments removed.

So I'm going to go ahead and run this and we'll see what we get here.

And yeah, I'd say that's probably very much what we're going for here.

.

So it's going to check and see if we have any duplicate characters

inside the string.

That nice function comment right there.

But besides that, we don't get any preamble header or footer

explaining what's

going on and no additional comments.

So I would say that adding in the system prompt was a lot easier than

trying to

adjust our prompt a ton or specifically the user message and add in a

ton of all

those additional requirements.

So let's say this is a pretty good solution.

Now, once again, if you had any trouble with this exercise, do not

sweat it.

We're going to continue to have a lot of exercises throughout this

course.
