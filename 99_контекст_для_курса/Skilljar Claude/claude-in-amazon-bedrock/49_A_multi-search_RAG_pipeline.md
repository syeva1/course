# A multi-search RAG pipeline

## Transcript

We now have an implementation for semantic search

and an implementation for lexical search.

So now we need to wire these things up together.

Let me show you how we're going to do that.

The first thing to notice is that the implementation

for both these searching functionalities

have the almost exact same public API.

So we have a vector index class on the left hand side

that has methods like add document and search.

And we have almost identical methods inside

of our BM25 index as well.

So to connect these two things together

into a single search pipeline,

we're going to wrap them up inside of a new class

that we will call Retriever.

This Retriever is going to receive a user's question

and then forward it on to the search methods

of vector index and BM25 index.

The Retriever will then receive the results from both them

and figure out some way of actually

merging the results together.

Now it turns out that the merge operation

is actually a little bit tricky.

So I want to go into a little bit of detail

on how you can merge the results

that are coming out of these different search methodologies

to combine the results together.

We're going to use a technique known as reciprocal rank fusion.

The easiest way to understand this technique

is to go through an example.

So let's do that right now.

Let's imagine that we run a search on the vector index

and we get outputs of section two, seven, and then six.

And then we do the same exact search on BM25

and we get six, two, and seven.

So now we need to take these two lists of results

and combine them together in some way.

To do so, I'm going to take all the search results

and put them together on a single table, like so.

So now I've got text chunk two, seven, and six

and I've recorded the rank from the vector index output

and the rank from the BM25 index output.

And to be clear, when I'm talking about rank,

I just mean kind of search output position.

So rank one, two, three, rank one, two, three,

I'm just kind of putting those same exact numbers

on this chart down here.

Once I have all those ranks in place,

I'm then going to apply a formula.

Here's the exact formula right here

and I know it looks really terrible,

but don't worry, it's not as complicated as it looks.

Here's how it works.

For every rank column we have,

so like that column right there and that column right there,

we're going to write out a separate term.

So here's the term for the first column,

here's the term for the second column.

In the first term, we're going to write out one over one plus

whatever number is right there.

So we end up with one over one plus one.

And then the second term will be one over one plus

whatever number is right there.

So one over one plus two.

Once we have calculated the score for each text chunk,

we're then going to sort the table based upon score

from greatest to least.

So we'd end up with something like this.

So we'd end up with text chunk for section two

as being the most relevant search result.

Section six would be the second most

and section seven would be the least relevant.

And this kind of makes sense.

We can kind of visually confirm

that these outputs make sense

if you just look at the individual rank outputs

from each search methodology.

So section two was rank one and two.

That means, hey, in general, it's trending up towards the top.

Section six is one and three.

That's kind of like in the middle.

It has a good score and a bad score.

And then section seven is two and three.

And so it trends down towards the bottom.

So with a visual inspection,

the results I think do make a decent amount of sense.

All right, so now that we understand

how we're going to combine the results together,

let's go back over to our Jupiter notebook.

And we're going to take a look at a sample implementation

of a retriever class and a sample implementation

of merging the results.

Okay, so back over here, I move on to the next notebook,

which is 005 hybrid.

Once again, there's a lot of setup up here.

So I've got the vector database implementation,

the BM25 implementation.

And now I've added in a implementation

for the retriever class as well.

The retriever has method of add document.

And if you call add document,

it's just going to take whatever document you pass in

and pass it off to each of the different indexes

that are contained inside the retriever.

So in our case, our indexes are the vector index

and the BM25 index.

Then the retriever also has a search function.

If you pass in some query text to it,

that query text will be passed off

to each of the different indexes

that are contained inside the retriever.

We then take all the results that come back

and combine them together.

So here's the merge logic that implements

that reciprocal rank fusion.

All right, so time to do a little test here.

Now I want to recall what led us down this entire path

was back on our vector database implementation.

So this notebook over here,

we found that if we search for something like,

what happened with incident 2023,

we got back some unexpected results

where we had section 10, which was good as the first result.

And then section three was the second result.

And that was really unexpected.

We want that second result to be software engineering.

So when we now run this hybrid approach

that combines together multiple different indexes,

my hope is that we're going to get first section 10

and then whatever section the software engineering one is.

I think it's section two.

So let's test this out inside of our new notebook.

I'm going to go down to the bottom

and I'll do a results is retriever,

search what happened with incident 2023, Q4011.

And I'm going to get the first three search results.

And then once again, I'm going to print them all out,

like so.

And I'll do the score, a new line,

the content of the document with just the first 200 lines.

And then just a little separator between each chunk.

So I'm going to run this.

And now we get a some much better search results

than what we have before. So I've got section 10,

and then section two, exactly what we wanted.

And then section five, but that one's not super relevant here.

So we now have a much better output

by combining together these two different search techniques.

And the nice thing about this is we were able to author

each of these indexes kind of in isolation.

They're their own separate classes.

And because we made each implementation

have the same exact API with that search function

and the add document function,

we were able to easily wrap them up

into this larger retriever class.

So if you wanted to, we could absolutely add in

some additional search index here

that maybe implements some other

completely different searching functionality.

And as long as it has that search function

and the add document function,

we can very easily add it,

have it generate some results

and then merge the results along with the results

coming from the other search methodologies as well.

Okay, so let's say this is a good success,

but we're not quite done yet.

There's still some other techniques

we're gonna go over to improve the accuracy

of our rag pipeline.
