# Accessing resources

## Transcript

We have defined two separate resources inside of our mcp server.

 So now our client needs the ability to request these resources.

 To do so, we're going to add in a single function inside of our mcp

 client.

 And remember, this mcp client is going to have some functionality

 that we're putting together

 that is going to be used by the rest of our application.

 And I've already put together that code already.

 So somewhere else inside this project, something is going to try to

 make use of this

 function that we're about to add into the mcp client.

 To get started, I'm going to open up the mcp client file again.

 I'm going to scroll down and find read resource right here.

 So our goal inside of here is to read a particular resource by making

 a request

 off to our mcp server, and then parse the contents that come back,

 depending upon its mine type, and then just return whatever data we

 get.

 So you'll notice that a argument to it is the URI.

 This is going to be the URI of the resource that we want to fetch

 from the server.

 In order to make request, just to get all of our types nicely,

 we're going to add two imports at the very top of the file.

 I'm going to add in an import for the JSON module and from pydantic,

 I will import AnyUrl.

 Then I'll go back down to our read resource function.

 I'm going to clear out the comment in the return statement.

 Then I'll get a result from calling await self session, I want to

 read resource.

 And then again, this is really just to get the types to work out.

 We're going to put in a AnyUrl with the input URI.

 Then I'm going to take from that result,

 response or to excuse me, result contents at zero.

 And I want to make this clear right here why we were adding this in.

 So just a moment ago inside of our inspector,

 we saw the response we get back.

 So this is essentially that result variable.

 Result has a contents list and there's going to be a list of elements

 inside there.

 We really only care about the very first one.

 So I want to get the first dictionary.

 I want to access the type property and the mine type.

 I want specifically the mine type because it's going to help me

 understand

 what kind of data we got back.

 If it is JSON, then I want to make sure I parse the text as JSON and

 return that result.

 So let me show you how we're going to do that.

 I'm going to add in a if is instance of resource types, text,

 resource contents.

 And inside there, if resource, mine type is equal to application JSON

.

 So this is our hint in use.

 If the server told us that it's giving us back some JSON,

 we need to make sure that we parse the text content as JSON.

 So I will return in that case a JSON loads of resource dot text.

 And then otherwise, if we don't fall into that if statement and

 return early,

 I want to just return resource dot text.

 So in this scenario would be returning the text as just plain text.

 We're not parsing anything.

 So this would really be the case in which we get back the contents of

 a single document.

 All right.

 So that should really be it.

 We've got our read resource put together.

 Now, again, I want to remind you, I know I've said this several times

,

 but I just want to remind you because I think it might be a little

 bit unclear.

 The code that we're writing inside of the MCP client is being used

 from several other places

 inside of this code base.

 So somewhere else in this code base, we're going to be calling that

 function that we just

 put together to get the list of document names and then eventually

 get the contents of a document

 to put into a prompt.

 So at this point, everything should essentially work because the rest

 of the work

 has already been done for us.

 So with that in mind, let's go back over to our terminal and we're

 going to test out

 our CLI application again and see if this mention feature works.

 Okay.

 So back over here, I'll do a uv run main dot pi.

 And now I should be able to say something like what's in the at.

 And there we go.

 I see my list of resources and I can use the arrow key to scroll

 through.

 Once I am at a resource I like, I'll just hit space and we'll insert

 that resource.

 So what's in the report dot PDF document and now I can tell you that

 everything is working

 as expected here.

 In other words, the contents of this document is being sent off to

 Claude inside of prompt.

 So if I submit this, I should see an immediate response and it's

 going to tell me what is inside

 of report PDF.

 So this time around, Claude did not have to use a tool to read the

 contents of the document.

 All right.

 So that is resources.

 Again, we make use of resources to expose some amount of information

 from our MCP server.
