# StreamableHTTP in depth

## Transcript

Let's do a quick recap on the last couple of videos just to make

sure that we are on the same page. The first thing that we understood

was that some MCP functionality, namely

things like sampling and notifications and logging,

relies upon the server making a request to

the client. Shortly after that, we learned that when

we are making use of HTTP in general, it's

kind of hard to allow a server to make a request to

a client. So these first two points are kind

of butting heads. They are at odds. We

need a server to build and make a request to a client to get full

functionality, but at the same time, that is hard to

do when using HTTP. Now, as I

mentioned, Streamable HTTP has a workaround

to fix this. And I'm going to show you exactly what that workaround

is and how the transport works in general in

this video. So we're going to finally get going to get clarity on

exactly what's going on. Lastly, keep in mind

that in some scenarios, we are going to set those two flags

to true, and we'll discuss why we've ever set them to true.

And when you do so, that breaks the workaround. And

that's kind of why streamable HTTP as a transport

is a little bit tough to wrap your head around, because we've got

this limitation around HTTP. We got the workaround,

but in some cases, we want to not use that workaround

for say, that's why it's a tricky subject.

Well, without further ado, let's get to it. Let's understand

how this transport actually works. I'm going

to begin by showing you a couple of different diagrams to help

you understand the behind the scenes process. And I'm going

to show you a short demonstration where you're going to see all

these requests actually made and the entire system come

together in a very small demo application. So

here we go. First thing I want you to recall is what happens

when a client initially connects to a server. According

to the MCP spec, the client must send an initialized

request to the server, server replies with a result,

and then the client has to make a follow-up request with the initialized

notification. At that point in time, the

server then considers the client to be connected and everything

is good to go. Now, as soon as we start to use the HTTP

transport, this flow changes ever

so slightly. So as soon as you start using this transport,

the initialized result that gets sent back from the server

is going to have a header inside the HTTP response.

This header is the MCP session ID. This

is a random string of numbers and letters that gets assigned to

our client as essentially an identifier for our

connection to the server. As soon as we receive that

header, we are required to include it in all follow-up

requests we make to the server. This allows the server

to identify our client. Now

after we have done this initialization and gotten that session

ID, here's where the magic part begins. So this

is kind of the big workaround that allows the server to make

requests to the client. As soon as we finish that

initialization, the client, optionally, it

doesn't have to do this, optionally, it can make

a GET request to the MCP server and

include that session ID inside the request.

The response we get back is very special. It is an SSE

response. SSE is short for Server-Sent

Events. This is a kind of response that can be held

open for an arbitrary amount of time. Once

this response has been established with our client,

the server can then stream back little bits of information,

essentially individual messages, down to our client.

So once this connection has been made, now at this

point in time, this is the real critical part. This

now allows the server to send down messages to

the client at any point in time. And this connection

can be used, essentially, to allow the server

to make a request to the client. So this

is the trick. This is the workaround that the HTTP

transport uses. It makes use of this long-lived

SSE response, and it's going to stream down messages that

it wants to send to the client. So now,

let's go a little bit further and walk through what happens now

whenever the client might want to call a tool, because

the complexity is not quite done just yet. There's one

other critical part for you to understand. So

now at the top of this diagram, I've got that SSE response

that we just created. And remember, that response,

that open connection, it has a session ID tied to

it. So the MCP server knows exactly what

that connector, which client that connection belongs to. So

then later on at some future point in time, while

that response is still running, our client might

decide to make a call tool request to the server.

When it makes this request, it's going to include its session ID

as a header. Then the MCP server

is going to open up a second SSE

response. So now at this point in time, we have

two separate SSE responses. The

first one at the top, it is intended to

be used for requests that are going from the server down to the client.

The second brand new SSE response is

intended to be used for messages that are related to

this call tool request. And importantly,

this is the critical part, this second SSE response,

it is closed automatically as soon as the call

tool result message is sent. So the

bottom response, closed automatically, very shortly

as soon as we get a result, and the upper response

is meant to be held open for an arbitrary amount

of time. Then, remember, our ultimate

goal here was to actually call a tool. So

maybe we call the add tool that we've seen many times.

And the implementation of that that I've shown you a couple times, it has

some logging messages inside of it and some progress notifications.

And eventually, it returns a result, which would be our call

tool result. Now here's another kind

of little tricky part here. Technically, both

the logging message and the progress notification

are really tied to the call tool request. So

you would kind of think that both these first messages

would be sent back in the bottom response because they're both really

tied to this call tool request. Well, that's

not quite how many of the SDKs work right now. The

progress notification ends up being considered to be separate

from the incoming call tool request. So the progress

notification actually gets sent in the first SSE

response. So that's the one that is meant to be held open for a long

time to allow the server to make a request down to the client.

And then the logging message and the actual call tool result

is sent back in the response to the POST request or the

GET tool request that was made. So that is

the entire flow. Now to make sure that all this is crystal

clear, I want to walk you through a very quick demonstration where

you can see all these different requests being made in a very visual

way. So I put together a little demonstration. First,

I've got a simple MCP server put together once

again with a simple add tool. The add tool is going to

log some information, wait for two seconds, make

a progress report, and then return a result. I've

connected to this MCP server with this

client that is running inside the browser. This client

will allow us to make a handful of different requests to the server and then show

the exact response that we get. Now, in total, this

client is going to go through the flow that you see on the screen.

So I know there's a lot here, but in essence, we're going to first

go through the entire initialization process with the stuff up here

at the top. We're then going to form the GET SSE

connection, which allows the server to send requests to

the client. And then we'll do a call tool request

that's going to form a second SSE connection that's

going to be responsible for handling messages related

to this particular call tool request. So let's

run this and see what happens. First, I'm

going to make the initialized request. So I'll send that off. That's

going to get me my session ID, which uniquely identifies

my client to the server on any future request. Remember,

the session ID is only provided when you are using the streamable

HTTP transport. It is not used with the standard

IO transport at all. You'll notice it begins with EAA.

This header is automatically taken and

applied to all future requests. So if I scroll down to

the next request, you'll notice the MCP session ID has

automatically been applied with the correct session ID

that I got from the request right above. So now that

we have sent the initialized request, that one

right there, our second request is initialized notification.

So I'm going to send that off. Okay, so now at

this point in time, we've taken care of the first three

boxes on here. So now we're going to make our GET request

to the server. This GET request is going to be

held open for a long time. This is what allows the

server to send a request down to our client at

any point in time that it wishes. It's going to be used for things

like sampling or any kind of server initiated

request. To make that request,

I'm going to use this little box down here on the bottom

right hand side. So I'm going to click on Start GET

SSE. This request is also going to include

that session ID as well. And now I have formed

that connection. So now in theory, at any point in time,

the server can send down a message to my client for

things like sampling or logging or progress notifications

and so on. And if I receive any of those, they

should appear inside of this box.

So now here's the last step. I'm going to call the

Add function. I've once

again got the correct session ID inside there. Now, to

remind you, when I click on this, in theory, we

would kind of want to see the log statement, progress

statement, and the final call to a result, all

to appear in this box right here, which represents

that part of the response. But in reality,

just because the way that the MCP SDK for

Python is set up, the progress notification is actually

going to be sent as a part of this response up here.

So we should see a log statement and

a call tool result right here. And we should see

the progress statement down here on the bottom right in that box.

So let's run it and see what happens. Okay,

so I'm going to run it. And then after a little delay,

because remember there's the two second pause inside there, we're

then going to get our result. So sure enough, down

here on the bottom right hand side, I've got a notification/progress.

So that is the progress statement. I'm at

80 out of 100% completion. So

that was sent in that response channel

right there. And then the actual response

to my call tool request has a logging

statement in the form of notification/message. And

then after that, I've got the actual result of the call tool

request. So this is my call tool result and

the answer to adding those two numbers together is eight.

And then remember, as soon as we get back that call tool

result, this connection is automatically closed. So

I see right there, yes, the connection was closed and

I can no longer receive any messages along this

SSE response we got. All

right, so that's it. That's the entire flow. So

now you understand what's going on behind the scenes with the streamable

HTTP transport. But we're not quite

done just yet. Remember, I said many times

that there are scenarios where you're going to want to set these flags

to be true and it's going to break portions of

this flow. So that's the last thing we need to understand.

Why would we ever set those to true? Because it is something that you

probably are going to want to do at some point and exactly what

does it break? So that's the last thing we really need to figure

out.
