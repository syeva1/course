# The StreamableHTTP transport

## Transcript

Time to discuss the Streamable HTTP

transport. This transport allows us to send messages

between a client and a server over an HTTP connection.

The nice thing about this transport is that it really enables remotely

hosted MCP servers. So whereas with the

standard IO transport, we always had to run the client

and the server on the same machine. With the Streamable HTTP

transport, we can remotely host our server. So

our remote server might be hosted at MCPServer.com

or something like that. This really opens the door to a much

wider range of possibilities around MCP servers,

because you can make a public server that anyone can

connect to. However, as I've hinted

at over the last couple of videos, there are some settings

that you might need to apply to this transport that

will limit the functionality of your MCP server,

specifically limit the types of messages that

you can send from the server back over to the client.

So that is the big issue that I want

you to be aware of. There are some settings that are going to restrict

the functionality of the server when you are using this

particular transport. So if you are ever developing

an application on your local machine and everything

is working just fine with the standard IO transport and

then you deploy and you start to use the HTTP transport

and things aren't working quite so well, this is the video you want

to come back to to understand what is going on.

To get started, I would like to give you a quick demonstration of

an app that I showed you previously inside of this course. You

might recall this Wikipedia research assistant. It

makes use of a next JS application that is connected

to an MCP server that implements a research

tool. This server is using the Streamable

HTTP transport, so I will be able to use

this application to show you a couple scenarios where the

Streamable HTTP transport doesn't quite

work as expected. First, I'm going to

send off a request here, just going to ask for

a report on archaeology, just to remind you what this application

looks like. So usually, when I send in a query

like this, I'm going to see a call tool request

here, and I get a nice progress bar, I get status

updates, and eventually, if I wait just

a little bit, I will get a full

response. Now over here inside the source code for

the MCP server, you'll notice that there are two settings that

I have commented out. Stateless HTTP and

JSON response. By default, these settings

are set to false, but there are going to be some scenarios

where you very much have to enable them or set them to true,

and it will go into more details on what those scenarios are a little bit

later on. Changing these settings to true is going

to impact the functionality of your MCP server,

and in some cases, it might even break how your client

works. So let me show you an example of this right away. I

want to change stateless HTTP to be true.

I'm going to save the file. Then I'm going to reload

the page and run the exact same query again.

And now you're not going to see a big difference

here, but there is something you'll notice right away. You'll

notice that now I don't get a progress bar anymore.

So no progress bar whatsoever above the log

statements. In addition, if I let this just sit here for a

while, and I'm going to speed the video up, We

will see that eventually the request fails entirely without

generating any text. Now I'm going to refresh

the page, I'm going to turn on JSON response

to be true, save the file, and then run

the exact same query again. Now we'll see that with

both these settings set to true, we get some even more surprising

results. Now I don't see any progress bar, I don't get

any log statements, and take my word for it if we let this

just sit here, the request is going to fail again.

So right away, we can see at these two settings, although seemingly

innocuous, have a big impact on our MCP

server. So the rest of this video is all about helping you understand

what these settings are talking about, why we might set them

to true, and exactly what's going on here.

First, I want to give you a very quick reminder of a diagram I

showed you in the last video. And I made a big deal about how

the standard IO transport had the ability to

initiate a request from the client to the server and then get a

response back. And likewise, the server

at any point in time could initiate a request

off to the client and get a response back.

So keep in mind for just a moment, as I give you a quick

review on HTTP communication.

So this is going back to some of the basics around HTTP,

and this is all HTTP communication, not

just MCP related stuff. So

as a reminder, if we have a client and a server, at

any point in time, a client can very easily make a request

off to the server. For example, on the right-hand side, the

client can make a post-request off to the server and

expect to get back some kind of response. No

issue with this setup whatsoever. So

translating this over to the MCP world, that means that if we

want to make an initial request from the client to the server, no

problem is going to work. And if we want to get a response

from the server backward the client, no problem whatsoever is

going to work just fine. However, if we consider

the reverse scenario, if the server wants

to initiate a request down to the client, that's

not quite so easy with HTTP requests.

At a very basic level, the server doesn't know the

address of the client, and the client might not even be publicly

accessible. So it's very challenging in traditional

HTTP for the server to initiate a

request down to the client. And that means that in

our MCP world, it's really hard for the server

to send that initial request down, and it also means

that it's kind of hard to imagine how you'd ever expect

to get a response from the client back to the server.

So if we consider this diagram that we looked at a moment ago,

where I had told you that there are some requests that

are being issued from the server down to the client, that

means that in this HTTP world, there

are some message types that are just plain

tough to implement with normal HTTP

requests. Specifically, sampling request,

listing routes, progress notifications, and logging notifications,

along with some other message types that I'm just not showing on this diagram,

are tougher to implement in an HTTP world.

And sure enough, that's kind of what you saw back over here

with this demo. As soon as I started to flip some of these

properties from false to true, well, you saw some

different parts of the application start to break and just not work

as expected. And what exactly broke?

Well, that's right. The progress notification broke, the

logging broke, and sampling, or essentially the

create message request broke as well. Sampling was being

used to author the fund research report.

Now I do have some good news. Even though making requests

from a server down to a client is challenging

in a pure HTTP world, the Streamable

HTTP transport does have a clever solution.

But there are some caveats that you need to be aware of. Let's

take a look at how the transport actually works and exactly what

those caveats are in just a moment.
