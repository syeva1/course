# JSON message types

## Transcript

We have gone through a couple of topics, and before we

move on, I just want to give you a little heads up.

You see, the next two or three videos are going

to be focused on MCP messages and the standard

IO transport. These videos might seem a little

bit dry and a little bit boring, but there's

a very important reason that we're going to cover these topics.

One of the big goals of this course is to help you understand the

streamable HTTP transport, which

allows clients to connect to remotely hosted MCP

servers. The issue is that in some cases,

there are some big limitations on what a MCP

server can do when it is using the HTTP

transport. Understanding those limitations can

be rather challenging and is a lot easier

to understand if you have a solid footing in MCP

messages and a standard IO transport.

So that's why we're going to spend some time on these first two topics.

So with all this in mind, let's take a look at the format that

MCP uses to communicate, specifically the messages

format. Clients and servers communicate

using JSON. We refer to these snippets of JSON

as messages. There are many different types of messages

defined inside the MCP spec, each of which are

designed for a distinct purpose. So let me show you an example

right away. As an example, if a language

model connected to a MCP client decides

to call a tool provided by MCP server, the

client will send a message over to the server. This

type of message is named a call tool request.

And I've got an example of a call tool request at the top of this

diagram. The MCP server will then run the tool

and then put the result of the tool run into another

message type named a call tool result. And

I've got an example of that on the bottom of the diagram as well.

Now, as I mentioned, the MCP spec defines

a full list of all the different message types. You

can find the full list inside the MCP spec

repository hosted on GitHub, and we're going to take a look at that in

just a moment. But first, to be clear about this

repository that we're going to take a look at, this specification

repo is separate from all the different SDK

repositories, like the Python or the TypeScript

MCP SDKs. This specification

repo has some different documents that describe how

the MCP spec works. So in this repository,

the full list of message types is written inside

of a TypeScript file. Again, to be clear here,

this TypeScript file isn't ever executed by

anything. It's not included in any of the different SDKs.

The types are just written in TypeScript because TypeScript

is a really convenient language for describing type

data. So I'd like to show you this schema file

that lists out all the different message types, just because there

are some really interesting insights to be pulled out of it. So

I'm going to navigate to the address you see up here at the top of the screen.

And then inside this repository, you will find at a certain

path a file called schema.ts.

The schema.ts file contains all the different message

types that are available to us. So inside this file,

I can do a search for call tool request.

And here we go. Here's an example of what a call tool request

looks like. So a call tool request must have

a method of tool/call, and then

a parameter object that has the name of the tool we want to call in some

arguments to pass into it. You might notice that in the diagram

I showed you a moment ago, back over here, there's also this

JSON RPC and an ID on there as well. Those

are actually defined on a separate object back inside the schema

file called a JSON RPC request.

So if I look that up, I'll see, okay, here is JSON RPC

request and it also have must have an ID as well.

Now out of this entire file, what I really want you to focus

on are some different types that are defined at the very bottom. So

I'm going to scroll down to the very bottom, very, very bottom of the file.

I'll then scroll up just a little bit, and I'm going to find a comment

that says server messages, and a comment that

says client messages. You'll notice that inside

these two sections, there are some kind of similarly named

types. So inside of client messages, there are client

request, client notification, and client

result. And then down inside the server section, there

is server request, server notification, and server result.

So let me show you a diagram. It can help you understand what these different

types inside this file and specifically the client

and server sections are really telling us. Okay,

here we go. So inside that type file, we can

kind of divide all these different types of messages

into two or three different categories.

First, on the left-hand side of this diagram, there are request-result

messages. These are message types that always

come in pairs. They're always going to have a name of

something-something-request, and then a paired

message type of something-something-result. So

as an example, we have call-tool-request that gets paired

up with a call-tool-result. We have an initialized

request that gets paired up with an initialized result.

All these different message types, I bet you could guess what they do

for us. They describe messages that we send off

either to a client or a server, and then the type

of message that we expect to get back in response. So

if I ever send off a call to request, I would expect

to get back a call tool result. The

other type of messages that we're going to work with are notification

messages. These are more like events. They

tell the client or the server about something that just occurred,

but they don't really need a response. So we have

types like progress notification, logging

message notification, tool change notification,

and so on. Now, back inside of the type file that we're looking

at a moment ago, you may have noticed that we have the headers here

of server messages and client messages. These

comments and the types inside of each one are meant to indicate

whether or not these types of messages are meant to be sent by the

client or the server. So for example, this

client request type describes all of the

different types of requests that are expected to be sent

from the client. And likewise down here, these

are all requests that are expected to be sent from the server. And

the same thing for server notifications, these are all notifications

issued by the server. And these are all notifications

that are issued by the client. So we can kind of summarize

everything in a diagram a little bit like this.

Now this doesn't show every type of message. I just mean to indicate

that there are some requests that are meant to come from

the MCP client, and I've got examples of those right here. There

are results that are meant to come from the server. There

are results that are meant to be sent from the client. There

are requests that are meant to be sent from the server, and so on.

All right, so here's the critical thing that I want you to understand.

The big takeaway from this video that's going to become really

important as we start to talk about the streamable

HTTP transport. The big critical thing to understand

here is that there are a bunch of different messages that

are meant to be sent from the server over to

the client. So the server request

types right here and the server notification types. These

are all messages that are going to be sent from the server over

to the client. And I know right now that might

seem like just completely irrelevant, just why is

that important to know at all? Again, this is going to become

really important as we start to look at the streamable

HTTP transport. So just keep that in mind for

a little bit.
