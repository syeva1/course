# Contextual retrieval

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to take a look at another technique for

improving the accuracy of our rag pipeline. This

technique is known as contextual retrieval. The idea

here is that whenever we take our original source document

and split it up into chunks, each individual chunk

no longer contains context of the original document.

Contextual retrieval aims to fix this by adding

in a pre-processing step before we insert each text

chunk into our retriever database. So

we're going to take each individual chunk that we have produced,

and our original source document, and place it into this

prompt and then send it off to Claude. This prompt,

as you can read, is going to ask Claude to take a look at this individual

text chunk and the contents of the overall source

document. We then ask Claude to write out a little

bit of text to situate or kind of place or

add some context to the individual text

chunk. We're then going to repeat this process for

each text chunk we have over here on the left hand side.

So as an example of the output we might get

from this, let's imagine that we put in Section 1

software entering right here, which includes a mention to that

2023 incident. And there's also

a similar mention down inside of Section 2 cybersecurity

analysis. The added context

that Claude might generate could look like this might say

something like this is a section from a larger report, and

this section includes a mention of this incident, and

that incident is also mentioned in this other section.

So now we're taking this input chunk and adding some

additional ties to the larger document.

Once Claude generates this extra little bit of context,

we're then going to join together that context with this

input text into something that we refer to as

our contextualized chunk. So right here

is the extra context that Claude generated, and

out here is the original chunk text. We

will then use this contextualized chunk as the input

to our vector index and our VM25 index

as well. Now right away, a very common problem that you're probably

going to run into Your original source document

right here, we're saying that we want to take all of the text out of that

original document and put it into a single prompt and then

send that off to Claude. In many cases, this

original source document might be simply too large to

fit into Claude by itself. If you're in that scenario,

don't worry, there's still a way we can make use of contextual

retrieval. If our source document is too large to fit

into a single prompt, here's what we might do.

Let's imagine that we are trying to contextualize chunk

9 down here. So this is the one that we really want to feed into

Claude, and ideally, we would provide the original

source document in its entirety. But instead, we

might decide to include some of the chunks from the very start

of the document, so maybe chunks 1, 2, and 3 right here, and

then some of the chunks right before chunk 9.

The idea here is that the starter chunks at the

very top of the document provide possibly a summary

or an abstract or something to kind of explain

what the entire document is about. And then the chunks

right before chunk nine are going to provide some context

for chunk nine itself. And chunk 4, 5, 6, while

they might be important, they're probably not going to provide quite

as much context as all the others that we might

include for chunk 9. So this is how

we can significantly tear down the amount of text we're going to push

into Claude to provide this context when trying

to contextualize chunk 9. Now, once again, let's

take a look at a Jupiter notebook to get a better idea of how

this stuff works. All right, so back over here, I've opened

up a new notebook called 007 underscore

contextual. We still have a ton of helper

code, and then I've added in a new cell with a function

named add context. This function is

going to take in a single text chunk that we're trying to generate

some context for, and some source text.

So that would be the text from the original source document. We're

going to add Ask Claude to write out some

succinct context to kind of place or give us a better

idea of what this particular text chunk is really all about

in the context of the larger document. We're

then going to get back our response. We're going to add together

whatever response we got with the original text

chunk and return it. So I'm going to run

that cell and I've already ran all the cells above it. Now

let's test this out really quickly. So I'm going to chunk

the source document like so.

I'm going to add in a new cell right here and I'm going

to call add context with

chunks at five and

the report text. And let's see what we get out.

All right, here's my output. Now, this might look like a lot,

but remember, this is both the added context,

which is really just that part right there, plus the text

from the original chunk, so section two

software engineering right there. So in this case, our

added context says this is a chunk of section two

from this larger report, and it is following

the methodology and it's before financial analysis,

and it is a part of a larger report that covers 10 separate

research domains. So I would say this is some

pretty effective context. It really gives us a better

idea of what this individual section is

a part of, the nature of the surrounding report

or the surrounding document around it. All

right, so next up, in the next cell down, I'm going

to still create my two indexes and the retriever, and

then here's where things start to get interesting. So

again, if we have a really large source document

where we can't fit everything into a single prompt, we might use

this little extra strategy where we include

just some starter chunks and the chunks from right before the

chunk that we're trying to situate. That's

what this code right here does. I've got some configurable

variables right here, so we are going to try to take two chunks

from the very start of the report, and then two chunks from right

before the chunk that we are trying to contextualize. I've

then got some code to make sure we don't get any duplicates or anything like that.

I'm going to get all that context from the report,

join it together, and then pass it off to the add context

function with the chunk that we're currently operating

on. Once we get back that contextualized

chunk, we will add it into our retriever.

So I'm going to run this. This

will take a while to complete because we are generating context

for every section inside of our report. Well,

once it is done, we can then go down and test it out.

Now, in this case, using the same query right here of what did

the entering team do with Incident 2023, we're

probably still going to get some really good output because we already

had good output. But you can imagine that by including this extra

context, if we add a much more complex document

with individual text chunks or sections that have a lot

more ties between the overall document, well,

then I would expect this contextual retrieval technique to

give me some better accuracy.
