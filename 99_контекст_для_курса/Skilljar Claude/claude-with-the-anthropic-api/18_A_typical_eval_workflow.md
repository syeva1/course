# A typical eval workflow

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to walk through all these steps implemented

by a typical prompt evaluation workflow. Before

we go through any of these steps, however, I just want you to understand two

important things. First is, there are many different

ways you can assemble a workflow. There's no one

set methodology set in stone that is standard across

0000:00:16,957 --> 00:00:19,481
the industry. The second thing to understand is that

there are many different open source packages and even paid

options online that will help you implement your own

workflows. Now, in this video

and this module, we're going to start to implement our own custom

workflow from scratch inside of a Jupyter notebook.

The reason we're doing this is to, of course, just help you understand

how these workflows behave, but also to help you understand

that you don't have to get a really heavy weight solution

to do prompt evals. You can start small just

to get started and get a sense of how everything works and

then scale up from there. All right, so let's get

to it. Step one of a typical prompt

eVal. Step one, we're going to write out an initial

prompt draft. So you and I will sit down

and just write out some kind of prompt that we want to improve

in some way. For this example, we're going

to have a very simple prompt that just says, please

answer the user's question. And then we're going to interpolate

in some user input. So some question provided

by a user. In step two,

we're going to create an evaluation data set. This

data set is going to contain some number of possible

inputs that we might want to put into our prompt.

So for us, our prompt only has one input, a

question provided by user. So for our

Eval data set, we'll have a list of different possible

questions that we might want to put into our prompt. My

data set is only going to have three different questions inside of it.

But in real-world Evals, you might have tens, hundreds,

even thousands of different records in your data set. Now

you can assemble these data sets by hand, or

you can of course also use Claude to generate them for

you. Once we have our eval dataset,

we're then going to feed each of these different questions into

our prompt. So we get a fully fleshed out prompt

that we can then feed into Claude. So we might have

prompt one right here, where we have, please answer the

user's question, and then a sample question out of our dataset,

like what's two plus two? And then we

will repeat for all the other records inside of our dataset.

So yours two and three. We'll

then feed each of these into Claude and get an actual

response out of Claude. So for the first one, we might get back

a response of something like 2 plus 2 is 4, and

then something about how to make oatmeal, and then something about

the distance to the moon. Once we

have these actual answers coming out of Claude, we're

then going to grade them in some way. During

this grading step, we're going to take each of the questions out

of our data set, and the answers we got out of Claude.

We'll pair them all off together, and we'll feed them into a grader

one by one. There are many different ways we can implement

this grader. We'll take a look at some of the different methodologies a little

bit later. The grader will then give us a score,

maybe from 1 up to 10, based upon the

quality of the answer that was produced by Claude. So

a 10 would mean we got a perfect answer and there's really no

possible way we could improve it. And maybe something like a 4

indicates that there's definitely room for improvement there.

Now, as you can guess, there's kind of a lot of hidden complexity

here with a grader, because you're probably curious or wondering,

well, how do we actually get these scores at all? And

again, don't worry. We're going to cover these grader things in

much greater detail in a little bit. After

we get these scores, we're then going to average them all together.

So in this case, I would add the scores together, divide

by three, and get an average score of 7.66. So

I now have some kind of objective way of

describing how well our original prompt performed.

Now that we have this score, we can then change

our prompt in some way and iterate or repeat

this entire process. So if I want to improve

my score, I might try adding in a little bit more detail to the

prompt to hopefully guide Claude a little bit more

and help to understand what kind of output we want. So maybe

I would add on to the end of the prompt, something like answer

the question with ample detail. Once

I have the second version of my prompt, I would then

run it through this entire pipeline again.

I would then have a score for prompt version one

and prompt version two. I could then compare these two

scores and whichever score is greater or higher.

It's kind of an objective sign, better than

nothing that tells me that prompt V2 in this

case is perhaps the better version of our prompt.

So now that we have a high level overview of this entire

process, as I mentioned, we're gonna start to implement

our own custom eval framework inside of

a Jupyter notebook. So let's get started on an implementation

in the next video.
