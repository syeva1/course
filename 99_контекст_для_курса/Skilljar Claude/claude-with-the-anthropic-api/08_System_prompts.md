# System prompts

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to take a look at how we can customize the tone and

style of response that Claude generates. To

help you understand why this is important, I want you to imagine

that we are making some kind of math tutor chatbot.

So a user will use this chatbot to ask for help in solving

math problems. For example, a user might ask for help

in solving 5x plus 2 equals 3. Now

there's a couple of things that we would want our math tutor to do

and a couple of things that we would definitely not want it to do. So

for example, we might want Claude to initially only give

the students some hints. Maybe just give them a little tip

or two in how they might initially approach the problem. And

then if the student still doesn't quite understand how to solve the

problem, only then maybe walk the student through

a solution step by step. We might

also want Claude to show solutions for a similar problem to

give the student a little bit of inspiration on how they might approach

this particular problem. Likewise, there are some

things that we would definitely not want Claude to do. For

example, we would not want Claude to just immediately respond

with a complete answer. And we would also not want Claude

to tell the student to just go use a calculator to solve

the problem or something like that. So to solve

this problem, we're going to use a technique known as system

prompting. System prompts are used to customize

the style and tone that Claude will respond with.

We define a system prompt as a plain string and then pass

it into the create function call. The first

line of a system prompt will usually assign Claude a role,

so we might directly tell Claude that they are a patient math

tutor. This will encourage Claude to respond in the same

way that a real math tutor was respond. He

would probably end up being patient, provide a lot of explanation,

but probably not directly answer a student's question.

They'll instead guide them to a solution. Now,

to see some action, let's go back over to our notebook and see how Claude

responds to math questions with and without a

system prompt. So back inside of my notebook,

I've made a new notebook and I've carried over just our

initial client creation and those three helper

functions. You do not have to create a new notebook. I'm

just letting you know that I did just to organize my code.

Then down here inside the next cell, I'm going to ask Claude a very

simple question. I'm going to ask it to solve a simple math problem.

And we'll see how it initially responds. It will probably just give us

a direct answer. And then we'll go back and add in a system

prompt to encourage it to give us a little bit more explanation,

kind of a tutor approach. So let's see how Claude

responds to us without a system message at all. I'm going

to make a list of messages. I'll add in a user

message to my list of messages. And I'm going to ask it to

solve 5x plus 3 equals 2 for x.

I'll then get an answer by calling chat with my list

of messages and print out the answer. And

then if I run the cell, I'm probably going to see an exact

step-by-step solution on how to solve this. Now

this probably is going to be useful for a student because it's going to

show them a step-by-step solution, but it's not quite

what we are going for. We want to make a student think, and

we want them to arrive at the solution on their own.

We just want to give them small steps and kind of guide them in the right direction.

So we're going to customize the way in which Claude responds

by using a system prompt. Let me show you how we do that. Up

inside my chat function, I'm going to make a new variable of system.

I'm going to assign to it a multi-line string. And

inside there, I'm going to put together a system prompt that I wrote

ahead of time. So I'm going to tell Claude that it is

a patient math tutor. It should not directly

answer student's questions. Instead, give them a little bit of guidance

on how to solve the problem. I'm going to make sure that I

pass in the system prompt as

the system keyword argument to the create function. I'm

then going to rerun the cell. I'll

then go back down and let's see how Claude responds

now. All right, this looks

like a much better answer. Rather than just directly telling

the student how it's solved the problem, Claude is now prompting the

user to go through a solution step by step. Claude

is asking the student to first maybe isolate x

on one side of the equation and then ask the student how

we might go about that. So now we've got a much more

interactive experience for the student. And this will help

them hopefully help them learn what's going on here a little bit

better than just giving them a direct answer.

Alright, so clearly using a system prompt is

a powerful tool for steering Claude in a particular

direction on how it should answer a given user input.

Before we move on, I want to do a little bit of a refactor to our

chat function. Rather than having a hard-coded system

prompt inside of here, I want to be able to specify a system

prompt whenever we call the chat function. So

in other words, I want to cut this right here, put

it down inside the cell underneath, And

then I want to be able to pass in a system prompt like

so. So now we have a much more reusable

chat function that we can use on a wide variety of different problems

in the future without having a hard coded system prompt inside

of it. So now we need to make sure that we take this system

argument and pass it into the create function. Now,

doing so is going to require just a little bit more work than you might

think. Let me show you why. I'm going to very quickly add

in a system keyword argument to the chat function, and I'll

default it to be none. If I now run

the cell, and then run the cell down here, everything

is going to work fine, exactly as expected.

However, if I go down to the chat function and I decide

that I do not want to provide a system prompt here at all,

so if I delete that and then run the cell,

I'll end up getting an error message. So we are not allowed

to pass in a system prompt of none.

So we need to assemble our parameters. We're going to pass

into the create function a little bit more dynamically. And

if we have a system of none, we do not want

to include this parameter at all. So let me show you how

we are going to do that with a small refactor. First,

I'm going to make a parameter dictionary right above. I'm

going to cut and paste in model max

tokens and messages. I'm

going to convert this to dictionary syntax. So

I use double quote, double quote, colons,

like so. I'll

then check and see if a system prompt was passed in. So

if one was passed in, then I want to add it in

as the system key inside

of the params dictionary, like so. Then

I'm going to update the create call down here to

star star parameters. And that's

it. So now I'm going to rerun that cell. I'll

go back down to the next one. And if I call chat

without any system keyword argument being passed in, no

problem. Everything is going to work just fine. And

if I decide that I do want to provide a system prompt, yep,

that's going to work just fine as well. OK,

so this looks good. So we now got support for a system prompt

inside of our chat function.
