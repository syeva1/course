# Environment inspection

## Transcript

The next idea around agents that we are going to discuss is

environment inspection. When we were taking a

look at computer use previously, you might recall something interesting.

After every single action that we saw logged out on the left

hand side, like typing or moving the mouse, we

always seem to see a screenshot immediately after, and

that's what I'm showing you in this diagram right here. Claude,

attempted to type out some text, and we see that logged in

the first panel up here, and then right after it, we saw a screenshot

appear immediately. I'd like you to look at

computer use from Claude's perspective. Claude

attempts to type or click somewhere and presumably

the page is going to change, but Claude doesn't really understand

how. Clicking on a button might navigate to a new

page or it might open up a menu. In order to understand

the result of any action it took, Claude needed

a screenshot to understand the new state or the

environment that it was in. This same

idea holds for any agent that we assemble. After

taking inaction, and sometimes before taking inaction,

Claude really needs a way of evaluating the result of the

action, often beyond whatever just a tool returns.

By helping Claude understand its environment, it can better

gauge its progress towards completing a task, and

also better deal with unexpected results or errors.

We can see a very similar idea when we make use of Claude

code. So in this screenshot, at the very top, I've

asked Claude to update the main.py file.

Now, the task I've given Claude here of adding in an

additional route is really simple. But before we

can ever modify that file in any way, this is going to

seem really obvious. Well, Claude needs to understand what

the current code is inside the file first. So

Claude needs some way of reading the contents of a file.

Now again, I know it seems really obvious, but I

would encourage you to think about this idea around reading

a file before writing to it anytime you're building an agent

of your own. This idea is even applicable to

our social media video agent. So whenever

we make a request off to Claude, we might give it a task like create

a video on Python and post it to my social media account, along

with our list of tools. Then we might provide some

special instructions inside of a system prompt, helping

Claude understand how can inspect its environment after

generating a video. Personally, if I

was relying upon Claude to use FFimPig to

generate a video, I would kind of expect it to maybe

sometimes make mistakes around the placement of dialogue.

So specifically, when audio clips would play, that

it generated using some text-to-speech functionality. To

help Claude better understand its progress around completing

a task when making one of these videos, I might

give it some instructions to make use of the BASH tool

specifically to run a program called, specifically Whisper

CPP. This is a program we can use to generate caption

files automatically out of a video. And those caption

files have timestamps inside them, so Claude could

use this program to make sure the dialog was placed

correctly. We might also advise Claude to

use the bash tool to run ffimpeg, which has

the ability to extract screenshots out of a video.

We might tell Claude to extract a screenshot from every

second or every 10 seconds, and take a look at the

screenshots just to make sure that the video looks as

it kind of expects it to look. This allows Claude to

inspect the results of its actions, the actual

video I created, and make sure that it's completing the task

as it should.
