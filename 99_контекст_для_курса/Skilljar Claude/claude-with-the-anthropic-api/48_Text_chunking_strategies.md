# Text chunking strategies

## Transcript

Inside of this video and the next couple of videos, we're

going to start to implement our own custom rag workflow

inside of a series of different notebooks. We're going to first

focus on just making the most simple basic rag

setup we can possibly make, and then we're going to add in some additional

steps over time. Now, as a reminder, A typical

rag pipeline looks a little bit like this to really simplify

things. We're going to take a source document, break

it up into chunks of text, then whenever user asks

us a question, we're going to find some relevant chunk of text,

put it into a prompt, and that's pretty much the entire thing.

So step one of this entire flow is to take a source document

and break it up into chunks of text. Now believe it or

not, this process of taking a document and breaking

it up into separate chunks is one of the more complex

steps of the entire rag pipeline. Simply because

how we chunk our document up has a huge

output on the quality of our rag pipeline. And

I want to give you an example right away to help you understand

why that's the case. So take a look at

this source document. It's just a couple of little lines,

and it's supposed to represent some kind of report from a

company or something like that. And just reading

through it really quickly, we can see that there's really three general areas.

We have a header, we have a section about medical research,

and then a section about software engineering. Now

there are many ways in which we could divide this thing up into

separate chunks, but I'm just going to suggest one way. I'm going to say

for every kind of distinct line inside this document, we're

going to make a separate chunk. So we'd end up with about five separate

chunks like the ones you see right here. If you consider each of these

different chunks now, you will notice something really interesting.

The third chunk of text right here is all

about medical research. That's what this text is about. It was

inside of the medical research section. But it contains

the word bug. So at kind of a high level,

if you just glanced at this paragraph alone, it

is almost like it's kind of about software engineering, just

because it contains the word bug. And then likewise,

down here, we have the software engineering section, and

inside of it is the word infection vectors. Infection

vectors is a little bit more of a medical term. So

once again, we have a section that is about software engineering,

but the language inside of it is kind of about medical research.

So now we want you to think about what would happen if we took these

chugs and we added them into our rag pipeline.

Let's imagine that a user asked a question of something like,

how many bugs did engineers fix this year? So

now our job as a part of the rag pipeline would

be to find the chunks of text we have that

are most relevant for the user's question. Well,

the user said something about bugs. So, well,

at first glance, this chunk of text right here seems relevant,

just because it contains the word bug. So we might

decide to take this chunk of text and add

it as context into the overall prompt.

And as you can tell right away, this is a huge error.

The user wants to understand something about software engineering

from the report. So we definitely wanted this section,

but we erroneously got something about medical research

instead. So this is an example

where a chunking strategy can easily introduce

huge errors and very bad context inserts

into your prompt. So to solve this problem, we're going to spend a lot

of time thinking about how we're going to take our original source

document and break it up into different chunks of text.

In this video, we're going to cover three different chunking

strategies or methods to divide our document

into separate chunks of text, each of which have some

feature or some technique meant to address the problem that

we just saw. So we are going to discuss size-based

chunking, structure-based, and semantic-based.

The first one we're going to cover is size-based chunking.

This is where we take our big old document, so a big

chunk of text, and we just divide it into a number of strings

of equal length. This is by far the

easiest technique to implement, and in some, also

probably the one you're going to see most often in production implementations.

So let's take a look at how size-based chunking is done. With

size-based chunking, we're going to take our original document and

divide it into some number of strings of more or

less equal length. In our particular case,

we have a source document with about 325 characters.

So we could decide just completely arbitrarily to

divide that into three separate chunks. And that means each

chunk would have about 108 characters or so.

So we might take the first 108 characters,

put them into chunk 1, the next 108 put them into chunk

2, and just repeat for the entire document.

Now, very simple technique, but right away it has

a big downside. And that is that each chunk is

probably going to end up with some number of cutoff words

inside of it. You can see right away the first chunk has

the word significant cutoff. So it's just significant

key. in the first chunk and then ends the word in the next

one. In addition, each chunk ends up lacking

context. So for example, the third chunk

down here unfortunately does not really include the section

header that was right above it. And this section header would

have provided a lot of context on what this text right

here is really talking about. So to solve

this problem that starts to come up right away if you use size-based

chunking, we can implement a overlap strategy.

An overlap strategy is where we are still going to do size-based

chunking, but we're also going to include a little bit of overlap

from the neighboring chunks. So for example, we have

the original chunk one right here, but we

might decide to include just a number of characters from

the next chunk down. So in this case, we might

include the rest of the word significant plus the end

of that entire sentence. So we would end up with

a chunk that looks like this that just has a little bit more meaning to

it. And then for chunk 2, we would still

have the body be this area right here, but we'd

include an overlap of some number of characters from

before the chunk and after the chunk. So with

the strategy, we are going to end up with a decent amount of duplicated

text. For example, in this case, we have section

1 medical research inside the second chunk, and that

was also included inside the first one as well.

So there is duplication of text, but the upside

here is that each chunk of text has, in general, a little

bit more context provided for it. The

next kind of strategy that you're going to see is structure-based

chunking. This is where we are going to divide off the

text based upon the overall structure of our

document. So we might try to find headers or paragraphs

or general sections and use those as our dividing

lines for each chunk. Implementing this strategy of chunking

with our document would be really easy because our document

is written with markdown syntax. We know that because it has

a little pounds right here, the double hashes

for each section. So we might look for these little

pound symbols, and then say that every time we see this kind

of symbol, that means we must be starting a brand new section. So

we could very easily write out some code to programmatically split

on the double hash characters. And we would end up with some

pretty well-formed sections, like what you see right here. Now

this might sound like a fantastic strategy, but unfortunately,

reality just doesn't favor it quite so often.

In many cases, you are going to be trying to ingest documents

that are not formatted with Markdown syntax at all. They

might be plain PDF documents that just contain

plain text, in which case you will not get these

very clearly delineated sections. So

again, even though this seems like a great technique, implementing it

can be really challenging, especially if you do

not have any guarantees around the structure of your

different documents. The last chunking strategy that we are

going to discuss is semantic-based chunking. This

is where you might take all of your text, divide it up into

sentences or sections, and then use some kind

of natural language processing technique to figure out how

related each consecutive sentence is.

you'll then build up your chunks out of groups

of these somehow related sentences or sections.

Now, as you can tell just by the description, this is by

far definitely more advanced technique, so we're

not going to look too closely into the actual implementation. The

only reason I mention it at all is just to make it clear that

there's really no set finite fixed number of chunking

strategies. There's really an infinite number of

ways in which we can decide to divide up our text. And

so deciding upon which method you use really comes down to your

particular use case and what guarantees you have around

the documents that you are trying to ingest. Now

before we move on, I want to go over a very quick example

with you. So I've got a Jupyter notebook put together

with three different chunking strategies implemented inside

of it. So I would encourage you to find a notebook called 001

chunking. Also make sure that you download the accompanying

report.md file and place

it inside the same directory as that notebook. This report.md

file has a little sample kind of fictional report

inside of it that we're going to use for testing purposes as

we learn about how to implement a rag pipeline. So

inside of here, you'll find a couple of different cells. The first one

contains a sample implementation of a chunk

by character. So this is an implementation based

upon the size-based strategy, where we are going

to divide up our text into strings of equal length that

also have some amount of overlap on them.

You'll notice that the arguments are going to be the text, the

size of each chunk, and then some amount of chunk

overlap. So again, that is the number of characters we want to have

on either side of the chunk. The next cell shows

how we might chunk by sentence. So very similar idea,

but now I'm using a regular expression to split

the text up into individual sentences, and then

each chunk will be formed out of some number of sentences

with optionally a little bit of overlap on each side.

And then finally, if we have really strong guarantees

around the structure of our document and its exact contents,

we might try to use a chunk by section, which would be

an example of structure-based chunking. So

in this example, it's going to look for a new line character, and

then two pound signs, and then a space. And that

is going to be our separation criteria. So we would

get kind of executive summary

would be the first chunk. Well, technically the second one, this

would be the first chunk up here. But then we would get everything

inside the executive summary all the way down to the table

of contents that would start off our second chunk.

And then the next chunk would be the methodology and then section

one and so on. This will give us the best formatting

for each chunk, because each chunk will consist of exactly

one section, but it really only works because

we have a guarantee around the structure of the document. We

know it is marked down, and we know that we're only going to see

that new line, pound, pound space, in

the case that we have a new section beginning. Now let's

test each of these really quickly. So back inside my

notebook, I'm going to go down to the bottom cell and

I'm going to first try out the chunk by character. So

I'm opening up the file, getting all the text out of it. I'm going to

chunk by character and then just print out each chunk with

a little separator between each one. So I'll

run that. and I will see that we get our first chunk

right here, second, and so on. And right away, you can

see that the default settings do not produce

very good chunks. So the default settings are

a chunk length of 150 with a overlap

of 20. So in this case, each chunk

doesn't really provide a whole lot of meaning. Like, what

does this sentence right here really do for us? And can we really

use it to answer any user question? I

don't know, maybe not. So we might decide to dramatically

change our default settings here. Maybe

I want a chunk length of 500 with

a overlap of 150. Let's see if that gives us something

a little bit better. Okay, that's a little

bit better than what we had before. So now I can

start to see the formation of actual individual sections

here that give us a little bit of information. You'll

also very quickly start to notice the overlaps. So

I can see addressing complex challenges.

Let turns out that exact phrase is included

inside of the chunk right above. So that's an example of

the overlapping that we get. All

right, next up, let's try our second strategy, which

is chunk by sentence. And

again, I'm going to use the default arguments. And

this one actually looks like it's pretty strong. So this should give us five

sentences by default in each chunk with one sentence

of overlap. And we are using a regular expression

to split up each sentence. So there might be

cases where it doesn't split a sentence correctly. But at first

glance, yeah, I'd say this looks pretty good. Each chunk appears

to give us a solid amount of information. And

then finally, we can try out chunk by section.

Now run that. And now we can see that the first

chunk is not going to contain a lot of useful information, but

everything after that is really, really strong because we

are getting exactly a single section each

time. I get just the executive summary, and

then the table of contents, and then section one, section

two, section three, and so on. So once again,

which strategy you use entirely

comes down to the nature of your document

and what guarantees you have around its structure. For

us, chunk by section looks fantastic. But

if we are expecting to receive user-provided documents where

there are no guarantees around the formatting of each document,

then using chunk by section is probably not going to

work out in the long run. In

that case, we might fall back to chunk by sentence. But

even this might not work pretty well, work out pretty well. Imagine

that we are trying to chunk user-provided code, for example.

Well, if we try to split code up into individual

sentences, we are probably going to get a lot of unexpected

results, because code tends to have periods

in very unexpected places. So

that might mean that we just fall back to the old reliable

standard, which is chunk by character. Chunk

by character is not guaranteed to give you the best results, but

it's going to work vast majority of the time and it's going

to work out reasonably well.
