# Tool schemas

## Transcript

Now that we've got our tool function put together, we are going to

move on to step two, which is where we are going to write

out a JSON schema. We are going to eventually send

all this configuration off to Claude. Claude is going to use

it to understand the different tool functions that are available and the

different arguments that must be provided to these tool functions

as well. The first thing I want you to understand here

is exactly what JSON schema is all about. So

this entire object you see on the right-hand side, this is

not technically a JSON schema per se. Instead,

at the very top, there is a name and a description. I'll tell

you what those are about in just a little bit. Underneath that,

there is a key of input schema. And then

assigned to that is that dictionary right there. What

I've now highlighted, that is technically what a

JSON schema is. So again, let me give you a little

bit more background. The idea of JSON schema

is not specifically tied to language models or tool

calling or anything like that. JSON schema is

a data validation specification. So

it is a set of rules that can be used to validate any kind

of JSON data. So again, it is not specifically

tied to language models or tools or anything like that.

The language model community decided at some point in time that

JSON schema is just a really convenient way of

wiring up and handling tool calls. This is a

widely understood technology that has been around for many,

many years. Now, at this point, I still haven't

really explained what the JSON schema spec is all about. So,

in total, this thing is used to inform its Claude

about the different tools that are available to it. We are going

to provide a name for the tool, so in this case it might be GetWeather,

and then a description for the tool. This description

is meant to tell Claude what the tool does, when

to use it, and what kind of data it is going to return. Best

practice is to make sure you have a description around three to

four sentences long. So even though right here I'm showing

only retrieved current weather, in reality, I would definitely

want to have a much longer description than this. Then,

under this input schema key is going to be the actual

JSON schema spec. This is going to describe the

different arguments that should be passed into our function. So

in this example back over here, if I had a git weather function

that received just a location, I would put in

input schema with location right here, it

needs to be a string, and here's a description of the purpose

of that argument. Again, we would want this description

of the argument to also be about three to four sentences

long, and help Claude understand exactly what

this argument controls and how it affects the overall function

call. Now, like I mentioned, it might be a little bit intimidating

to think that you have to write out all this configuration on your own. Luckily,

I've got a trick that is going to help you write out a almost perfect

JSON schema spec for every tool you ever put

together. So let me show you the trick. First,

I'm going to go back over to my editor and I'm going to find our

tool function. So for us, it is the get current date

time function. I'm then going to take this over

to a Claude window. So I'm at Claude.ai

here. I'm going to write out a very simple prompt. I'm

going to ask Claude to write a valid

JSON schema spec for the purposes

of tool calling for this function.

And then I will also ask Claude to Follow

the best practices listed in the

attached documentation. Then

I'm going to go into put in my tool function, like

so. And then here's the real trick. I'm going

to go over to the Anthropic API documentation. In

the User Guide section, there is a entire page on

tool use with Claude. This entire page has

a lot of different best practices, and examples of good

tool descriptions and bad tool descriptions. So

I'm going to just copy all the text here, go

back over to my Claude window, paste it in as an

attachment and run this. Claude

is then going to respond with probably a very strong

JSON schema spec. So I'm now going to copy

this, take it back over to my editor, and

I'm going to paste it in right underneath my existing get

current date time function. So I'll say get current

date time schema,

like so. Now, as a little naming pattern

that I like to use here, I'll give my tool function,

whatever name I want, and then the schema to match up with it

will be underscore schema. So the same name underscore

schema. And it makes it a lot easier to keep track of my

different schemas. There's one last thing I'm going to do.

At the top of the cell, I'm going to add in an import from

anthropic.types. I will import

tool program. I'm going to take

this tool param and wrap it around this entire dictionary.

So I'll put in right here, tool param, opening

parentheses, and then a closing parentheses down here at

the bottom. Adding in this tool param

thing is not strictly necessary. In other words, our code

is still going to work without it, but it's going to prevent a type

error later on when we eventually take this schema and make

use of it.
