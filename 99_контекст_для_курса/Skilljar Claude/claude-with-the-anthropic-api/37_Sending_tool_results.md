# Sending tool results

## Transcript

On to step four, where we run the tool function that Claude

requested us to run. Remember, in the last step, we got

back a response from Claude, that included a tool

use block. Let's print that out inside of our notebook really

quickly. So back over here, remember we've got this response

variable, I'm going to go down, create a new cell, and

print out response. Now inside of here, we get back

a message that has a content property, and the second

block inside that list is a tool use block.

So to access that thing, I would do response content

at one. Then inside of here,

we're given a input field. This is the input

or the arguments that Claude is requesting that we pass into the

get current date time function. So to get that dictionary

right there, we would chain on a dot input.

Now when we add on the dot input, you might end up getting a

type error here. We're going to ignore type errors

just in this video when we're going to come back very, very quickly and

fix all the type errors. But just so you know, if you see any type

errors in this video, totally fine. Just ignore them for right now. So

now our goal is to take this dictionary right

here and provide it to our get current date time function.

Just one thing to be aware of here. Remember our get get

current date time function. defined

back up here doesn't take in a dictionary. It takes in a

keyword argument of date format. So

to convert that dictionary into a list of keyword arguments

and apply them to the function, here's what we would do. I'm

going to call it get current date time star

star and the response content one input.

And now if I run that, I'll get back my current date time

in the real world. So for me, it's 241 or 1441.

Besides the type error that we need to fix up, that ended up being

pretty easy. So let's now move on to step five. So

in step five, we are now going to send a follow-up request

back to Claude. This request is going to include our full

conversation history. So we'll have our original

user message. It'll have the assistant message that we just

processed with a tool use block. And now we

are going to append onto the very end another user

message. This user message is going to have a new kind

of block that we have not seen before called the tool result

block. Let me tell you about how this block works. The

tool result block is going to be placed inside of a user

message. The tool result is going to contain the result

of running a tool. So we're essentially taking whatever we get back

from the tool function that we just called and we are feeding

it right back into Claude. The tool result block is

going to have a couple of different keys inside of it. And it's

important for you to understand exactly what these keys are doing.

The first one is probably the trickiest to understand, the tool

use ID. So let me very quickly tell you what the tool use

ID is all about. I want you to imagine for just a moment that

we create a new tool called calculator. And this

tool is meant to evaluate a math expression. And

then maybe a user sends in a message of something like, what's

10 plus 10? Also, what's 30 plus 30? In

this case, Claude might want to make two separate calls to the

calculator tool. One call to solve 10 plus 10

and a second to solve 30 plus 30. To

do so, Claude will respond with an assistant message that has

multiple tool use blocks inside of it. So

we might have tool use block one right here, where

the expression that we need to evaluate is 10 plus 10. And

then in the second, we might have an expression of 30 plus

30. We would then execute our calculator tool

twice, once for this expression and once for this

expression. And then we would send a follow request back

to Claude. Inside of our follow request, we would add in

a user message that has two separate tool result

blocks. So we'd have to result one and to result

two. Now when we send these back into Claude,

Claude needs to be able to figure out which result belongs with which

request. So we've got request one and request two,

and then result one and result two. Claude

doesn't want to just rely upon these things being ordered in

the same order. Instead, it's going to make use of

IDs. So inside the original tool use,

we have an ID up here of AB3. And

then in a second, we have the ID of PO9.

Inside of our follow-up request, we send back to Claude. We need

to make sure that the ID, so we put down here, match up

with the output. So in other words, PO9.

being tied to 30 plus 30, then we would want to make

sure that we have P09 tied to 60 down here. And

likewise, AB3 with 10 plus 10, we'd

want to have that tied to AB3 with an output of 20. So

that's what the tool use ID is all about. It helps us

tie tool use requests to tool

result outputs. The other properties

on here that you need to be aware of is content, so asking me whatever

output you get from your tool function. Even if

your tool function will return something like a number or

a dictionary or a list, you're just going to turn

it into a string, usually by just converting into plain

JSON. And then finally, optionally, we can

also put in an is-air field. If

anything goes wrong with running your tool function, you will set this to

be true. By default, it's always going to be false.

Now that we have a better idea of what this tool result block is all

about, I want to give you a quick reminder of what we need

to do next. So we just got back an

assistant message from Claude that asked us to run a tool.

We know that was asking us to run a tool because it had a tool use

block inside of it. We then executed our tool

with the provided arguments. So now that we have the result

of the tool function, we need to make a follow-up

request back to Claude. Inside of this request,

we're going to include our full message history. So

it's going to be our original user message, the assistant

message with a tool use block inside of it. And now

we are going to append in one additional message, a

user message, that has a tool-result block.

That's what we just discussed. So it's this thing right here.

Inside of this tool result block, it's going to have the result of the

actual function call. So let's now go back over to our notebook

and we're going to get our list of messages and add in this new

user message with the tool result block inside

of it. All right, so back inside of my notebook, I'm

going to get my list of messages. I'm going to

append in a new message that has a role

of user. And then a content

list that will contain just one block, it's

going to have a tool result block. So we'll

give it a type of tool underscore

result. a tool use

ID that matches the ID of this

tool use block right here. To get access

to that ID right there, we will refer to

response content 1.ID.

And when I put that in, I'm going to once again get a type error.

Remember, we are toiliocave type errors for right now. We're

going to ignore it and we'll fix it up very shortly. I'll

then add in some content. So that's going to be the

result of calling my function right here. So

I'm going to assign the result of calling get current

daytime to how about just result.

You're going to rerun that. And then I'll

refer to content result. And

then finally, when we ran this function, there was no error. So

I'll put in is error false,

not strictly necessary, because that is the default, but I'll

put it in there. Anyways, Okay,

so now that we have updated our list of messages, I'm

going to print out the list. just

to make sure we are doing everything correctly. So now we

have our entire conversation history here. We have the

original user request. We've got Claude's request

for us to use a tool. And now we have appended in

a new user message that has a tool

result block inside of it. So now the last

thing you need to do is take this list of messages and send it

back into Claude. I'm going to add in another code cell

down here at the bottom. And once again, call Claude

messages create with my model

max_tokens. the

list of messages. And then whenever we make a follow

up request that includes some tool use, we need to also

include the original tool schema. Even though we

are not probably going to use any tools here, we still have to

tell Claude about the existence of this tool because we

are referring to it inside of the tool use block right here

and the tool result block right here as well. So

we need to make sure that we still include our list of tools, which

would be a list of get current date

time schema. And

that should be it. So now let's run this. And

we should see a final response out of Claude. And

so there it is right there. Here's our final response. We have

a text block that says the current time is 1504.

Well, that is a successful tool call. So we've

gone through the entire process. Let's do a very quick

review. So everything began with us writing out a tool

function and then writing a tool schema to describe it.

The goal of the tool schema was to help Claude understand the different

tools available to it and how to actually call those different tools.

We have to include that tool schema with every request that

we make from here on out. So that's why I'm showing it right here and

down here as well. When Claude responded to us, it

sent back an assistant message that had two separate blocks

inside of it. So a text block right here and

a tool use block right here. The text block is intended

to be displayed to a user, so the user understands what's going

on. And the tool use block includes

some information about a tool that Claude wants to call. So

it includes the name of the tool it wants to call along with some

input arguments to it. Then on our server,

we executed the tool function, and then

we sent a follow-up request back to Claude. The

follow-up request included the entire conversation history, along

with the list of tool schemas as well. The final

message inside of our request was a user message,

then included a tool result block. The tool

result block is used to inform Claude about the result

of running some tool function. So inside this block,

we put the current time, which is what Claude was really asking

for. then Claude sent us one final result

that was just an assistant message with only a text block.

And it made use of the input that we fed into it through

this tool result block.
