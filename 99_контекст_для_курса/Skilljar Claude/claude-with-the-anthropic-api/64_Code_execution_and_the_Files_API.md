# Code execution and the Files API

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to take a look at two features offered through

the Anthropic API. And these two features are going to seem

a little bit different, just a little bit separate, but it turns

out they can be combined together in really interesting

ways. So let's get to it. We're going to first begin by understanding

what the files API is all about. Earlier

on inside this course, we discussed how you can pass images

into Claude and ask Claude to interpret the image

itself. And I showed you how we can include an image block,

which can include the actual raw image data, and

coded in base64. We also saw

a very similar process being used for uploading of PDF

documents as well. The file's API allows

for a little bit of a twist on this whole system.

With a file API, we can make an individual

request ahead of time to upload a particular document,

be it a PDF or an image or a text file or whatever

else. So we might make an initial request off to Claude

to upload that file. We'll then get back something called

a file metadata object. This file metadata

object contains some different information, but the most interesting

or important property to us is the file ID.

This ID allows us to refer back to that uploaded file

at some point in time in the future. So then later

on, at some point in the future, a user can submit

a message like what do you see inside this image. And

inside of our image block right here, rather

than including the raw file data

from the image itself, we can include just the

file ID. So we can put in the file ID right there.

And that's going to get Claude to go and find that image that we

had uploaded ahead of time. Claude is then going

to try to interpret the image as best as it can.

So the file API allows us to upload a file

ahead of time and then make a request later on and

include some data about the original file inside the request

to Claude. So you can really just think of this as being another

way that we can provide an image or PDF to Claude.

Now that we understand the basics behind this file API,

just the idea that allows us to submit a file and

then refer back to it at a future point in time, we are

going to switch gears and discuss the other focus of this video,

which is code execution. Code execution

is a server-based tool. So we do not have to provide

an actual implementation for this tool. All we have to do is provide

a predefined tool schema. Inside

of a initial request we make off to Claude, we will include

this especially defined tool schema, along with

whatever user-submitted message we want to include. Then

behind the scenes, Claude can optionally decide

to execute some amount of Python code inside of

an isolated Docker container. Claude

can run code inside this container multiple different times.

Whatever Claude prints up from these code executions

will be sent back to Claude and the Claude can interpret the results

and write a final response to us. These Docker

containers do not have any network access. That means

that Claude cannot write out any code that will make a network

request or attempt to access any kind of outside API.

Instead, to get information into the Docker container

and to get information out of it, we rely upon mixing

together that file API that we just discussed, along

with this code execution tool. So let me show

you how this works in total. Let's imagine that

we have a CSV file called maybemydata.csv,

and it contains a lot of tabular information that we want to

get analyzed by Claude. Rather than going through

some really complicated code setup where we ask

Claude to write out some code and then we manually execute that ourselves,

we can instead make use of this file API and

the code execution tool together to get Claude

to automatically analyze the file and produce some results

for us. So to do so, we will first

use the file API to upload our CSV

file. So we'll initially up here, upload

our CSV file with some amount of data inside of it. And that's

going to give us back a file ID. We

will then include that file ID inside of a follow-up

request to Claude. So we will add in something

called a container upload block. A container upload

block just means that we want to take a file that we previously

uploaded to Claude and somehow inject it or place

it inside of the container. So we're going to add

in this very specially crafted block with a type of container

upload and a file ID property of whatever ID

we got back from when we had uploaded our original file.

Then inside of a separate text block, we'll ask Claude

to do some analysis, maybe something as simple as analyze

the data inside this file. Then behind the scenes,

Claude is going to make use of the code execution tool.

Claude is going to have access to that uploaded file inside the Docker

container. So Claude can write out some code to

analyze the file, process the results, and then give

us a full report of all the data inside

that file. Let's now take a look at an example

of this entire flow. So I've put together a notebook

at a time called 005 code execution.

I've also created a separate CSV file called

streaming.csv. Inside of here is

a bunch of fake data from a video streaming

service. This file contains information about

particular users, what subscription tier they

are included in, so what level of access they have,

and then a lot of statistics about this particular user. So

in total number of hours they have viewed, top genre,

et cetera, et cetera, and then at the very end, the very last

column is called churned. Churned is

an indication of whether or not the user has canceled

their subscription. So as euro means they

have not canceled their subscription, and one means they

have canceled their subscription. Now

I could write out a lot of code to analyze the data inside

this file and figure out whether or not there is some correlation

between these different features and whether or not a user

has canceled their subscription. But instead of doing

all this myself, I might decide to just hand the entire

task off to Claude. I could first upload this

stringing.csv file and then ask Claude

to make use of its code execution tool to do an

analysis of all the data inside of here. So let me show

you how we would do that. First, back inside

the notebook, I want you to take a look at the helper function

cell. If you scroll down a little bit, you'll notice that

I added in a couple of different functions. I added

in a upload function, which will automatically upload a

particular file given a file path. I have

added in a list files function, which will list out

all the different files we have uploaded to Claude. We

can delete a file, we can download a file, and

we get information about a particular file as well. We're

going to make use of these functions very shortly. So I'm going

to collapse that cell, and of course, make sure that I run it as well.

Then in the next cell down, I'm going to attempt to upload the streaming.csv

file. So I'm going to run that cell right away. And we'll

get back our file metadata object. And inside of here,

there's our ID. So that is the unique ID that identifies

this file to Claude. And if we ever want to include it inside of a

conversation in the future, we're referred to that particular

ID. Then inside the next cell down,

I've got a short prompt that is asking Claude

to run a detailed analysis and figure out

why customers are canceling their subscription. I'm

also asking Claude to print out a plot that

summarizes all of its findings. Then after

that, I've got the Container Upload block, which is going

to actually include that uploaded file inside of our request.

So now I want to run the cell and just be aware

that whenever you make use of code execution, it sometimes

actually takes a little bit of time to complete. The

response we get back is going to contain a tremendous amount

of text. Inside this message is going to be all the code

that Claude decided to write, along with all the print statements

and output that it got, along with some final analysis

as well. Claude can decide to run code multiple

times inside the container, so we might actually see multiple

code blocks and multiple execution results inside

this message. Now to help you understand what's going on inside

the message, I took all that content and I format

it just a little bit more nicely so we can understand what's happening.

So here's that message. I got my content list with a

variety of different blocks inside of it. The first block

is a text block, which is going to contain some

amount of text that just has Claude framing the initial problem.

Claude is then going to provide a server tool use

block. This is going to contain some amount of code that Claude

wants to run inside the container. And then here is our

code execution tool result. It's going

to contain some information about the actual execution

of that code. So data from standard out,

standard error, return code in case there's any error

handling required, and so on. And then it looks like

in this case, Claude decided to run some more code

after that. So it did some further analysis right here,

got back some more results, and it did some more

analysis, and so on. So in this case, Claude

ran some code several times in row to do some thorough

analysis. Now, whether or not you decide

to show all this content to your users is

totally up to you and the particular application that you are working

on. If you want to, you could build up a really nice

looking report, maybe something like this. So

I took all that information that we were just looking at, and I used

Claude to just format it very nicely. So now I

can see the initial response right there. So that's the exact

information from the initial text block that we got back.

Then here's my code execution tool. There's

the code that Claude decided to run, along with the output

from executing it. And we could see this is repeated several

times in a row. So now I've got some more text

right here, another code execution, and so

on. Finally, I want to show you one of

the most interesting aspects of code execution.

So you may recall that back inside this prompt that

I sent off, I asked Claude to include one

detailed plot summarizing its findings. Claude

behind the scenes did generate a plot inside of

a image file, and that is stored inside of our Docker

container. We can use the file API

to download that generated plot inside of the Docker container.

Let me show you how. First, I'm going to go and take a close

look at the message that I formatted over here. So

if I scroll through, I might eventually see a text

block that has an extra nested content

property. And inside that, I might see a type of code

execution output. So here's mine right here. If

you don't see it inside of your response, try searching for code

execution output. Right underneath that is

a file ID. So I can use this file

ID to download the file. I'm going

to copy it, go back over to my notebook, I'm

going to go down to the very bottom and add in a new

cell. Here we go. I'm

going to call download file, which was one of those predefined

functions that we took a look at at the start of this video. And

I'm going to paste in the file ID that I just found inside

the response. I'm going to run this. It's

going to run successfully. And now if I take a look at the same

directory that my notebook is in, I'm going to find maybe

a PNG or a JPEG file inside there. Their

name is going to be random. It's not truly random per

se. It's going to be whatever Claude decided to name it. If

I then open up that file, if I then open up that

file, I'll see a bunch of information that Claude extracted

from that CSV file. So this is a great

visualization that tells me everything I need to know. So

churn right by viewing hours, by monthly cost ranges,

and so on, Claude did a very thorough analysis

here to help me understand the contents of this file. So

as you can see, based upon this demo, combining together the

file API and the code execution tool

allows us to delegate rather complex tasks off

to Claude. Of course, you are not limited

to just doing data analysis. You can use the combination

of code execution along with the files API to

execute a wide variety of different tasks. And

it's really up to you to decide how to integrate this into

your application.
