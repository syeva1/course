# Implementing multiple turns

## Transcript

Now that we are done with that refactor, we are going to start to implement

a function like this run conversation function. And

reality, our real implementation is going to look almost identical

to what you see here on the right-hand side. Remember, the

entire goal of this function is to keep calling

Claude until it no longer asks to use a tool. When

it doesn't ask to use a tool anymore, that is a sign to us that

Claude has a final response that is ready for us to send

back to our users. And the first thing for us to really understand

here is how we know if Claude wants

to use a tool or not. We could just take a look at

the response message and see if there's a tool use block

inside there. But there's a little bit more convenient way

of doing this. Back inside my notebook, I'm going to

run that little sample again where I'm making use of

client messages, create directly, not using our chat

function. I can run that, and here's my

message response. Now very inside of here, you'll

notice that there is a field named Stop Reason, and

it is set to a string of tool underscore use.

So let me tell you about that field just a little bit. This

field tells us about why Claude decided to stop

generating any more text. Our current value of

tool use is a sign to us that Claude has decided

that it needs to call a tool. So if our response

message, the assistant message that we get back from Claude has a

stop reason of tool use, that is a very clear and

immediate sign that Claude wants to use a tool. There

are some other possible values of stop reason. And

we could definitely check for these, but definitely the one you're going to check for the most

is probably going to be tool use.

So that's how we're going to implement that little if statement right there.

All right, so let's go back over to our notebook. We're going to start to

implement this run conversation function. So

back over here. I'm going to clear out that cell. It

was just there for demonstration purposes. I'm going

to define my run conversation

function. It's going to take in a list of messages,

and then we will set up our loop. Inside of here, we

will get a response from calling Claude through our newly

upgraded chat function, which now supports tools. So

I'll pass in my list of messages, along with some tools that

Claude can call. In this case, we currently only have one

tool. So I'll add in right here. It's our get current

date time schema. Then

I'm going to take that response I get back and add it into my message

conversation history using the newly upgraded

add assistant message function. I'm

then going to print out that response using the text

from message function we just put together. I'm printing it out

just we have an understanding of what Claude is currently doing. So

I'll print out text from message

with response. Okay,

now here is the part where we are going to use the stop reason.

We need to take a look at the message that we just got back from Claude

and understand whether or not Claude wants to use a tool. If

it doesn't want to use a tool, then we want to immediately break

out of this while loop. So we'll say if, response

dot stop underscore reason is

not equal to tool underscore use, then

that is a sign that Claude is all done and it doesn't need to make

use of any more tools. So we will immediately break.

If we get past that if statement, then we know that Claude wants

to call a tool. So we're going to put together a new

function in just a moment. We're going to call it Run Tools.

We're going to pass in the message that we just got back from Claude. The

goal of Run Tools is to take a look at all the tool

use blocks inside this message and run the appropriate

tool for each one. I'm going to define the Run Tools

function in a new cell right above Run Conversation.

So up here, I will put together a new function called Run

Tools, and this is going to take in a single

message. Now this function is going to be

just a little tricky to put together because we have to write it out

assuming that there might be multiple tool calls inside

of here. So let me show you a diagram to just make sure it's really

clear what needs to happen inside of run tools. As

a very quick reminder, whenever Claude gives us back an assistant message,

it can possibly have more than one tool use block

inside of it. And we took a look at this earlier. So

if we ask Claude initially to add together 10 plus 10

and 30 plus 30, it can send back to us two

separate tool use blocks. One might ask us to run

a calculator tool to evaluate 10 plus 10. And

the second tool use block might ask us to evaluate

30 plus 30. So we need to set up this

run tools function, assuming that we might have more

than one tool use block. So here's how this

function is going to work. We're going to take a look at

that message that we just got, specifically the content

property on it. Remember that content property is going to be a

list of blocks. Inside there, we might have a text

block that tells us what Claude is currently thinking

or what it's currently doing. We don't really care about that text block

too much, so I'm going to delete it out of this diagram. And

then we're left with just the two separate or possibly more

for that matter, tool use blocks. So

inside this RunTools function, we are going to iterate

over all the different tool use blocks we got. And

for each one, we're going to run the specified tool with a

given inputs. So we'll take a look at this name

field right here. We'll find the appropriate tool function

to run, and we'll run it with the given input.

Then we're going to take all the outputs from each of these different

tool runs, and we're going to assemble them into separate

tool result blocks. Remember, a tool

result block is how we communicate the result of running

a tool back over to Claude. Once we have

assembled all these different tool-resolved blocks, we're

going to put them all together into a list and return them

from the Run Tools function. Okay,

so let's try to implement this. I know it's confusing. I know there's a

lot going on here, but the code itself is actually

not as bad as it might seem initially. So back

over here, inside of Run Tools, first thing

I'm going to do is take a look at this message's content

property. That is the list of blocks.

And I'm going to extract only the tool use

blocks. So I'll say tool request.

is block for block in message.content

if block.type is equal to tool

use. So again, a little bit of a filter operation here.

We are getting just the tool use blocks because those are the

only ones we care about. And I'm calling this specifically

tool request because I think it makes a little bit more sense than

tool use. These are requests by Claude for us

to use a tool. Then I'm going to make

an empty list called tool result blocks.

This is going to eventually contain all the different tool results

that we create. Then I'm

going to iterate over all these different tool requests.

So for tool request

in tool request. So now we are iterating

over each individual tool request. So this is where we

now need to run a specified tool with the given

inputs. And we know which tool we want to run based

upon this name property. So we will say if

toolrequest.name is equal

to curly the only tool that we have which is get current

date time. Then I want to run

the get current date time function

with the star star inputs from the tool request.

So tool request dot input.

That's going to give me some tool output.

And I'm now going to take this tool output and use it to assemble

a brand new tool result block.

It has been a while since we have made use of a tool result block,

so let me just give you a quick reminder on what these things are. All

right, so on the left hand side is a tool use block. This

is what we are currently working with. This is Claude's request

to use a tool. On the right hand side is a

tool result block. So this is the response

that we are formulating to Claude's request to run a

tool. Remember that a tool result block

has a couple of different properties that we need to assign to it. First,

it's going to have a tool use ID. This needs

to be exactly equal to the ID from

the tool use block that is causing us to run

a particular tool. Note here that the

ID field over here on the left-hand side, it's called ID, and

then on the tool result block, it's a totally different property. It's a tool

use ID, but they need to be exactly equal. Then

content is going to be the output from our tool

run, so the actual tool function. We need to make sure we just encode

it as a string, no problem there. We can then also add

on that optional is air property, if an air occurred

when we ran the tool. And then finally, we also

need to add in a type of tool underscore

result. All right, so back over here,

now that we have our tool output, we're going to assemble our

tool result block. And it's going to have all those

properties I just pointed out to you. It will have a type

of tool result, a

tool use ID of

the tool request.id.

It will have a content And I'm going to

take whatever I get out of my tool, and I'm going

to encode it as JSON using JSON

dump string. I

need to make sure that I import JSON, so I'll do that at the top this

cell. There

we go. And

then finally, the is air. I'm

going to set that to false for right now, and we're going to add

in a little bit more robust air handling in just a moment. So

now that we have created our tool result block, we're going to add

it into our list of two result blocks. So

I'll then do a tool result, blocks

append in tool result block.

And then finally, outside of the for loop, I will return

tool result blocks. Okay,

so this is the start to our run tools function.

So we've at least got an idea of what it does for us. We're

going to filter out all the different tool use blocks for each

one. We're going to run some given tool function and

then put the result into a tool result block, assemble

all the results and return that list. So now we're going

to add in two quick improvements to this function. First,

we're going to add in a little bit better air handling. So we

are currently always saying that there is no air. That's

definitely not accurate. There might be a scenario where we run into some

kind of air when we are running our tool function. So

I'm going to immediately make a small improvement here to capture any

air that might occur as we run our tool to

do so. I'm going to wrap that with

a try. Except

statement. I'm

going to fix my indentation like so. And

then if I get down into the accept statement down here, I

still want to put together a tool result block and

add it into this list. But now I want to have an

is error of true. And I probably want to take the error

message and put it into the content field right here so

that Claude gets some better understanding of what error just occurred. So

I'm going to copy tool result block right here, paste

it down inside of the accept statement. I'm

going to change is error to true. And

then for content, I'm going to put in an F string where

I put in air with E.

So again, I'm providing some information back to Claude, help you

understand why an air occurred. And remember, whenever

an air does occur, Claude might try to run your tool

again with some better arguments or better formed arguments.

Okay, so that's our first improvement. Now, the second

improvement I want to make right now, we only are considering

one single type of tool, the get current

date time tool. Remember, later on, we might have

multiple different tools. So besides just get current

date time, we're going to eventually support adoration

to date time and set a reminder. And honestly, we're

going to add in another one even after that. So using

this pattern right here, where we have an if statement that's just

checking for get current date time, not really going to scale

too well. So to figure out what tool to run

and actually run it, I'm going to make another helper function

right above run tools. And I'm going to call it run

tool. This is going to take

in a tool name and an input

to that tool. And then inside of here, this is where we

are going to do a series of if statements or any kind of check to

figure out which tool function we need to run and then actually run

it and return the results. So if tool

name is get current date

time, Then I'm going to return,

get current, date time, with

star star, tool, input.

So now with this approach, if we ever add in additional tools,

we can just put in additional if checks right here. So

if tool name is whatever other tool we have,

we can run that particular tool function. So we are going

to very shortly come back to run tool and add in some additional tools

in just a little bit. All right, so now to make

use of that function, I'll come back down here.

I'm going to indent that block

right there to the try, the accept, and the tool results.

I'm going to remove the if statement and

then replace get current daytime right here with run

tool. And I'm going to pass into it our

tool request.name and tool request.input.

There we go. Okay, so this was

a little bit of a painful refactor, but this

is our run tools function. No more changes required.

It's going to work pretty well. And we've also got our

run tool function put together, also working pretty well. So

now the very last thing we need to do is go back down to

our conversation function and

make use of run tools. So

here's our call to run tools right here. So run tools

is now going to return our list of tool result blocks.

So I get tool results. I'm going to add

that into my conversation history. So add user

message with messages and tool

results. then outside of the

while loop, so I'm making sure them outside of while I'll

return the list of messages. And

that's it. Okay, so now this run conversation

function captures that entire loop that we discussed. So

whenever we go into run conversation, we're going to call

Claude, we're going to get back some assistant message.

If the assistant message is asking for any tools, then we're

going to continue on past the if statement. We're going to run

those tools, get the results, and add them in as

a user message to our list of messages. Then we're

going to go back up to the top of the while loop again, and

call Claude another time with the list

of tool results inside of those messages. And

we're going to repeat this process over and over again until Claude

doesn't ask for a tool use anymore. So

now here's the point where hopefully everything's

going to work. We'll do a quick test down here. So

I'm going to make a list of messages. I'll add

a user message to it.

And I'm going to ask Claude to do something that's going to probably require

two separate tool calls. So I'm going to ask Claude what the

current time is in our hour, hour, minute format,

and then same thing for second format. So in theory, Claude

is probably going to break this up into two separate tool

calls. I will then call run. conversation

and passing the list messages. I'm

going to rerun all the cells inside this notebook because

we have now changed a tremendous amount, so we'll do a run

all, and then we'll take a look at the response we get.

So it looks like it definitely is the right answer right here, but I want

to take a look at the list of messages to really understand what is happening.

So initially, we have our user message. We then get

the initial response back from Claude. It has a text block

and a tool use block. So once again, a message

with multiple blocks inside of it. And this is why it's so critical now

to make sure that all of our code will correctly handle multiple different

blocks. Inside this first message, we have a tool

use block where Claude is trying to get the current time in

our minute format. We then

respond with a tool result. And then here's the interesting

part. Claude then decides to make a second tool

call back to us. So in the second tool call, we

don't have a text part anymore, once again highlighting

the importance of correctly handling multiple different

tool parts inside of a single message. Inside

this second message, we've now got a tool use

block. Claude is now going to try to call get current daytime

in seconds format. We then send the

result back to Claude, and then we get a final response

from Claude that has just a text block that says, here's

the answer to your original query. So this

is a perfect result that definitely highlights every

step that we just went through. The entire process of

running our conversation until we have a response

that is not asking for tool use. And

inside of our run tools function,

the importance of taking a look at all the different blocks

we get back, pulling out just the tool use blocks, and

then running a tool for each of those blocks, formulating

the response into a tool result, and then sending all

the different tool results back into Claude. This video

has been long and probably rather confusing, but we've now got

an excellent example of multi-turn tool

calling. So now the last thing for us to do inside of

this project is make sure that we can support multiple

different tools. We need to add and support for the adoration

to daytime tool and the set reminder tool as well.
