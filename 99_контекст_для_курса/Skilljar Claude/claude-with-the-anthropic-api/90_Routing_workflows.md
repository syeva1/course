# Routing workflows

## Transcript

Our next workflow is going to show us one way of improving this

social media marketing tool. So once again, we'll imagine

that a user is going to enter in a topic, we're then going

to produce some videos somehow, and post them to

a user's social media account. Now, there's

something I really want you to think about about the script generation

process. In other words, the actual tone and language

used in these different videos. Given two different

topics, such as programming on the left hand side, and

maybe surfing on the right hand side, we would really

expect to get video scripts that are very, very different

in nature. So on the left hand side with programming, we

would want to get a lot of information, carefully explain

definitions, and probably just overall a video

that is meant to be educational in nature. And if

user entered in surfing as a topic, we would probably

want to get back a very different video script. Probably something

that is much less educational in nature and doesn't

have a long definition on what surfing is or

anything like that. So let me show you a workflow that

we could use to make sure that a given topic will

result in a video script that fits the nature of that

topic really well. First, we would sit

down and think about all the different possible genres of

videos that users might ask us to create. So

we might decide that the topics that users are going

to give to us are going to fit into one of six different

genres. Entertainment, educational, comedy,

and so on. So in our example back over here, programming

might be educational and surfing might be entertainment.

Then for each of these different genres, we might write out a

script generation prompt. So if someone asks for

a topic that we categorize as being educational

in nature, we would ask Claude to write a script using

this prompt right here. And the prompt is asking Claude to make

a clear, engaging script that has some interesting

examples and interesting questions and so on. If the

user gives us a topic of surfing, we might categorize that

as being entertainment. So then we would take this prompt

right here, put in the topic as surfing and

feed the whole prompt into Claude and ask Claude to write

a script about surfing that maybe has some trendy

language and engaging hooks and so on. So let me show

you what this entire flow would look like in practice.

We would initially send a request off to Claude that contained

just the topic the user had entered, maybe something

like Python functions, and ask Claude to categorize

this topic into one of our different categories that we just

came up with. In this scenario, Python functions

might be most closely related to the category of educational.

So then we would take this response from Claude and then make a follow

up request asking Claude to write a

script that has some clear, engaging information

about Python functions that has thought provoking

examples. And then presumably we would get back some

script with those different qualities and a tone

appropriate for an educational video. This is

an example of a routing workflow. In

a routing workflow, we are going to take the user's original input

and feed it into a routing step. This routing

step will probably be a call to Claude itself, asking

Claude to categorize the user input or task in

some way. Then, depending upon Claude's answer,

we're going to forward the user's input onto some very

particular follow up processing pipeline. So maybe

this one right here, or this one right here, or this one right here, and so

on. But probably only one of these different three.

Each of these different routing options might have a different

workflow implemented inside of it or a customized prompt

or a customized set of tools that are specialized for

handling the exact task that the user is asking for.
