# Parallelizing Claude Code

## Transcript

In this video, we are going to explore one of the greatest productivity

gains around Claude Code. Because Claude is a lightweight

process, you can easily run multiple copies of

it. Each instance can then be given a task, and

the separate instances will then work in parallel. This

technique allows a single developer to command their own team

of virtual software engineers. So in the remainder

of this video, I like to show you some of the specifics of implementing

this workflow on a real project. The first big

challenge to address is the fact that two instances

of Claude might want to work with the same file around

the same time. They might end up writing conflicting code

or even invalid code, because they're not aware that

some other process is modifying that same file. To

solve this, we can make sure that each instance gets its own

separate workspace. Each instance can then work

with its own copy of your project, make changes,

and then eventually merge those changes back into your

primary project workspace. A common

way of implementing this is by using a Git work

tree. Git work trees are a feature of

Git, so if your project is already managed by Git,

you can use work trees immediately. Work

trees are like an extension of Git's built-in branching

functionality. A work tree allows you to create

a total copy of your project inside of

a new directory on your development machine. Each

work tree corresponds to a separate branch. So

if we have Feature A on the left and Feature

Branch B on the right, we can easily create two

separate folders, each of which contain a complete

copy of our codebase. Then

we can run separate instances of Claude Code for

each work tree. They will each work in their own

separate environment in total complete isolation.

Once each copy of Claude Code has then finished

some feature, we can then commit the work for each work

tree, and then merge them back into our main

branch, just like we would merge a normal branch. Now,

this might sound like a really complicated workflow

that would be very tough to manage. But remember,

you can delegate an amazing amount of work to Claude Code,

including tasks around Git. So we can

actually get Claude Code itself to manage this entire

workflow. Let me show you how.

First, we can write out a prompt that will ask Claude

to create the work tree for us. We might ask

it to also open up our code editor inside of the

newly created work tree folder. And that's what

I'm asking for inside this prompt. I'm asking Claude

to make a new work tree inside of a directory at

trees slash feature a. I'm then

going to ask it to Simlink in some dependencies because

those are not tracked by Git and so they will not be automatically

copied into the WorkTree directory. And then I'll ask

Claude to also open up my code editor inside

of that new sub directory. Now let me show you how this

would actually all work. So I'm going to take this exact prompt

right here. I'm going to run it inside of Claude code.

Claude will then create the work tree, create the Simlink

of the virtual environment, and then open up a new code

editor instance inside of this new sub project

folder. Inside of my original editor

window, I'll see that there is a new trees directory.

Inside there is a feature, a folder. Inside

that feature, a folder is a total copy of my project.

And that copy has been opened up automatically inside

of this new editor window. So inside this new

editor window, I can launch Claude Code

and ask it to fulfill some task,

maybe add in some new feature or write tests or do whatever

else I need. And now this instance of Claude Code

is running in total isolation. Before

I ask Claude Code to do anything inside of here, however,

I want to point out that this is a really long

prompt to remember. And it's really tedious to have to copy

paste all over the place anytime that we would want to create a new

work tree. So we're going to do a quick side topic here

really quickly, a little side feature of Claude

Code that makes it really easy to create and merge

in these separate work trees. So we could

automate this entire prompt by making use of another

feature of Claude Code. Support for custom

commands. You can add in custom slash

commands to Claude Code by creating a markdown

file inside of a special directory inside of your project.

The special directory is dot Claude slash commands.

inside of a file inside that directory, we'll write

out our entire prompt, and then we can easily run

this custom prompt any time we want to. Let

me show you how we can use this feature to easily create a

new work tree. So inside my original

editor window, I'm going to make a new folder

called .Claude, inside there

I'll make another folder called commands, and then

inside that I'm going to make a file called, how

about createworktree.md. And

then inside of that, I'm going to paste the prop that we

saw just a moment ago. Now,

this prompt has a hard coded feature name or hard code

branch of feature underscore a. And I don't always

want to have exactly that string. So I'm going to replace it with

a special string. of

dollar sign arguments, all capitals.

This allows us to inject some additional argument

when we actually run this custom command. So now if I

save this file and restart Claude

Code very quickly, I

can run slash project colon

create work tree. It's

called specifically create work tree because that is the name of the file I

create inside that commands directory. I'll then put in a space

and then the name of this new work tree. And I'm going to call

it feature underscore B this time around. So

now feature B is going to be taken and substituted in

for wherever I had placed dollar sign capital arguments.

So now if I run this, I should very quickly

see a new work tree created. And

before long, I've got my new code editor instance. So

now this one is open inside of work tree feature

underscore B. And I can see that the additional work

tree has been created inside that trees directory. Now

that we've seen how we can create multiple different work trees, I want

to give you a full demo here. I'm going to

create four separate work trees. Each one is going

to be designed to complete some different tasks. So I'm going to have four

instances of Claude Code running. The first one

is going to add in some tests around documents. The second

one is going to add in some logging. The third one is going to add in two new

tools, and the fourth one is going to add in a subtract

tool. I'm going to run all these tasks in parallel,

and then I'm going to merge the changes from all of them back into

my main branch. So for step number one, I'm

going to create four separate work trees. I

now have four separate editor instances, one for each feature

that I want to implement. I will start up Claude Code in

each and give each of them some directions on some feature to

add in. When the work tree is complete, I will ask

Claude to commit that code. Then

when they are all complete, it is time to merge all these changes

from these different branches back into my main branch.

We do not have to do this by hand. Instead, we can

ask Claude to do it for us. So I put together another prompt

here, which I'm going to wire up as an additional custom command

inside my project. This prompt is asking Claude

to go into one of our different feature work trees. Take

a look at the most recent commit, just to understand what was done,

and then attempt to merge those changes back into the main branch.

I'm going to add this prompt in as another custom

prompt inside my project. So inside of Claude

commands, I'll make a new file. I'll call this one merge

work tree. Paste that in. I'll

then restart Claude Code. I'll

then run the merge work tree command. And

I'm going to first ask it to merge in how about the document

test branch that was just created. I

can then repeat this process for all the other work trees

as well. When

I merge in the Subtract feature, there will be a merge conflict,

but Claude is going to automatically resolve the conflict for me.

When everything is merged in, I can then ask Claude to clean

up all these different work trees that have been created. And

that's it. So I have now implemented four separate features

entirely in parallel through the use of Git work trees.

This is clearly a really big productivity increase. And

it scales up to as many different instances as I feel

like I can manage at a single time as an engineer.
