# Introducing Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Transcript

In this module, we are going to discuss a tremendous

amount about a technique referred to as retrieval

augmented generation, or rag for short.

In this video in particular, I want to give you a really solid idea

of what rag is all about. To help you understand

rag, we're going to walk through a very quick example.

So I want you to imagine that you have a very large

financial document, like the one seen on the right-hand side. There

might be a tremendous amount of text in this. It might

have anywhere from, who knows, a hundred to a thousand

pages. And we might want to ask, Claude,

very specific questions about very specific areas

of the document. For example, we might want to ask a

question like, what risk factors does this company

have? Now, presumably, this document might have

some relevant information inside of it. So we

need to solve a very fundamental issue here. How do

we get some information out of this document and into Claude

so it can help us answer our question? I

want to show you two possible ways that we could solve this problem.

So option number one, we could take all

of the text out of this document and just place it directly

into a prompt, like the one you see on the right hand side. So

we might ask Claude to answer a user's question, we'll

then put in the user question, and then take all the

text out of the document and put it into the prompt as well.

Now, this is perhaps not the best solution.

It might work, it also might not. Just so

you know, there is a hard limit on how much text we can

feed into Claude. So if this document is really,

really long and we take all the text out of it and feed all

the text into Claude, we might immediately end up getting

an error, which means just right off the gate, this

solution would not work if our document is really,

really long. The second problem with this approach

is that Claude gets a little bit less effective as

your prompt gets longer. So if you start putting

a tremendous amount of text into a prompt, Claude

is going to have just harder time understanding exactly what

you want and answering your question because there is just

a tremendous amount of information inside the prompt. And

then finally, larger prompts cost more

money to process and take longer to process.

So there's a financial burden here as well and a

user experience burden because they just have to wait

around longer to get back some kind of answer. So

option number one might work in some scenarios, in

other scenarios, it might fail entirely. So

at that point, let's take a look at option number two. Option

number two is a little bit more complex. So Option

number two has two separate steps. In step

one, we'll take all the text out of the document and

break it up into small chunks. Then

whenever a user asks a question, we're going

to take their question and put it into the prompt as before.

But we're also going to go through an extra little step. We're

going to examine the user's question very closely. And

we're going to find a chunk of text that seems

most relevant to the user's question.

In this case, if a user asks us what risk

does this company face, and we have a chunk of text

right here that seems to be about risk factors, we

would then take that chunk of text and include

it inside of the prompt. So

now we are focusing all of Claude's attention on just

this very small snippet of the overall financial document.

And hopefully Claude can do a much better job of answering

the user's question than before when we were just putting

all of the text of the document into the prompt.

So option number two has a distinct set of upsides

and downsides. The upsides here are that

Claude can focus on just the relevant content. Secondly,

this can scale up to really, really large documents

with a tremendous number of pages. And it

also works if we have multiple documents. We can

take all these different documents, separate them all into chunks,

and then once again, only include chunks relevant

to user's question inside of a prompt. This

technique also generally leads to much smaller prompts, which

means it's going to take less time to run and it's

going to cost us a lot less. But there

are some big downsides to this approach as well. First

off, there's just naturally a lot more complexity.

This requires a pre-processing step, where we take all

the text out of the document and split it into

chunks. We also have to figure out some way

of searching through all these chunks to find the ones that are most relevant

to the user's question, and we even need to define

what it means to be relevant to the user's question.

When we do find some relevant chunks and include them in the

prompt, there's really no guarantee that they will

contain all the context that Claude needs to actually answer

the question. If the user asks what risk does this

company face and include only the risk factor

section, that might include some other important area

of the document, maybe strategy outlook, where some

of those risks get addressed in some way. And

then finally, there are many different ways in which we can split

the text up. So we could just take all the text of

the document and divide it into equal portions.

Or we could go through the document and find all

these different headers and say for every header,

we're going to make a new chunk. So we might have chunk one and

then two and then three somewhere down here. There

are many different ways in which we can define what a chunk is.

And so we have to do a little bit of evaluation and decide

which technique is the best for our particular application.

So as you might guess, option number two is

rag. It is retrieval augmented generation. As

we just discussed, rag has many big

upsides and many big downsides as well. There's

a lot of technical challenges around it. It requires

a pre-processing step. We also have to figure out some

kind of searching mechanism to find those relevant chunks.

We have to chunk documents. All in all, there's just

a lot more work than option number one. So

whenever we are considering implementing rag inside an application,

we really have to analyze all these different steps and figure

out whether or not it is right for our particular use case.

All right, so now we have kind of a very, very high level

understanding of what rag is all about. Let's start

to take a look at the actual implementation of this process

in just a moment.
