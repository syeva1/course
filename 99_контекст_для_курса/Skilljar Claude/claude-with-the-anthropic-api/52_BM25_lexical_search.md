# BM25 lexical search

## Transcript

We've got the first iteration of our RAG pipeline put

together. Everything looks good right now, but we're going

to very quickly realize that, well, maybe we are

not getting the best search results. Let me show you an

example. If you open up the report.md

file and scroll down just a little bit to

the software engineering section, here

it is right here. You'll notice that it has the statement

of INC, which is short for Incident, 2023

Q4-011. And

it looks like that search term occurs three times

inside of this paragraph. So here's one right here, two

right there, three right here. And if I continue

searching throughout the document, I'll see that it is also mentioned

down here inside of Section 10, Cybersecurity Analysis.

It's mentioned inside the header, and then one time inside the actual

paragraph itself right there. Now, I

want to try searching for this term, this incident

2023 Q4011. And we're just

going to see what happens. In other words, what search

results do we actually get back using semantic search?

So back inside of my notebook, I'm going to update the user

query right here to be what happened with incident

2023. Then I'm going to rerun

all cells and we'll see what result we get.

All right, so take a look at this. It's a little bit

surprising result. We get section 10, which

is good. That's definitely the result we would

want to see at first, in the list, because section

10 is all about this incident. But then

very surprisingly, the next result is section 3,

financial analysis. Well, if you open up section

3, right here, you'll

notice that nowhere inside of section 3

is that incident ever mentioned. So we

are getting some output from our semantic search that is a little

bit surprising here. What we really wanted to get

back was section 10 and then section 2,

but what we got was section 10 and then unfortunately

section 3. And section 3 appears to be

completely irrelevant when it comes to investigating

this incident. So even though the semantic search

technique we put together is really fantastic and it's going

to work well a lot of the time, there are these

corner cases where it really just doesn't quite work as

expected. So let's take a look at a technique

we can use to improve our search results and hopefully

get the results we want, which is Section 10

and then Section 2. All right, so here's

the general strategy we are going to use. Whenever

a user asks a question, we're going to feed that question

into our semantic search side of the equation, which

is generating those embeddings and using the vector

database. But then in parallel, at the same

time, we're also going to implement a separate lexical

search system. Now, lexical search is more

like classic text search, where we are going to break down

the user's question into individual words and then trying

to find chunks of text that seem to include

those words. Once we go through the search

process in both different systems, we'll get two

sets results and then we will merge the results together.

And the hope here is that we'll get a little

bit better balance of search results where we

get both the kind of semantic aspect and the plain

text search aspect included in one result

set. So hopefully we will eventually get a result that

looks like this over here. Now

to implement this lexical search, there are

a tremendous number of methods for implementing a text

search, but a very common method that you're going to see

used in RAG pipelines, like the one we are building right now, is

a technique referred to as BM25. Now

this is short for Best Match 25.

In the rest of this video, I'm going to give you a high-level overview

of how this algorithm works, and I'm going to take a look at

a notebook that actually implements BM25, so

we'll be able to play around with it directly and see what kind of search

results we get. So here's the general idea behind

the BM25 algorithm. Now, again, I'm going

to give you a high-level overview, and I'm going to leave out a couple

of smaller steps just to simplify things and make it

easier to understand. Everything is going to begin with

us receiving a user's query. And let's imagine this

case, they put in a search string like this right here, just

A, so the word A, and then incident 2023Q4011.

In step one, we're going to tokenize the user's query.

And that means we're going to break it up into separate chunks.

There are different ways in which we can tokenize a user's

query, but right now we're going to use a very simple method,

which is to just remove punctuation and break

up the return all terms based upon spaces. So

in this case, I would end up with separate search query

terms of A and an incident 2023.

Next, we're going to see how often each of these different search

terms occurs across all of our different documents, or

in our case, really text chunks. So let's

imagine that we only have two text chunks in this scenario. So

we're going to see how often the word A, and the word

incident, blah, blah, blah, occurs across each

of these chunks. And it looks like this first chunk right here has

A right there, A right there, and

then the second one has A, A, A.

So in total, I would count all those up and I would have five

A's. And then I would see how often I have incident

2023. It looks like there's only one

right here. So I'd end up with a frequency of

one. Next up, we're going to assign a relative

importance to each term based upon its usage

frequency. So in the case of the word A, it

was used five times. And because it was used rather

often, we're going to say this term is not super

important because it is used all the place across all

of our different documents, or again, our case, our text

chunks. But incident 2023, that

was used very infrequently, which means it is

probably going to be of greater search importance.

Then finally, in the last step, we're going to find the text chunk

that uses the higher weighted terms more often.

So in this case, the first text chunk

right here, it only has two A's, whereas the second

one has three A's, but A's are not

super important because they're used rather frequently across

all over different chunks. However, Text Chunk 1

uses Incident 2023 one time,

and that is a highly weighted term. It's a really important

term. So in this case, we would say this is probably

our best text chunk, and we would want to return this

as a prime search result. Now again, to see

all this in action, let's take a look at a quick Jupyter Notebook.

So back inside of my editor, I'm going to

find a new notebook. This one is called 004

underscore BM25. Again, at

the top, I've got some code relating to a chunking by section.

I've then got a basic implementation of BM25

in the form of this class called BM25index.

So I'm going to collapse that cell, make sure I run it. I'm

going to read the contents of our report file. And

then we're going to go through three separate steps here. We're going to first

chunk the text by section. We're going to create a BM25 index

store. And we're going to add each text chunk to it. And

then we're going to attempt to search the store. And once

again, our hope here is that we're going to maybe get

some search results that look a little bit closer

to this. Maybe not exactly these results, but

I definitely want to see the sections that use Incident

2023 before I ever see some

results that don't include that search term at all.

So let's see how we do. Okay, let's

take care of step one here. We need to chunk the text

by section. So we've gone over this a couple times

now. We'll say chunks is chunk by

section with text. Next up, I'm

going to create a store. And

I'm going to loop over all my chunks and add them in

as documents to the store. So I'll say for chunk

in chunks store add

document. And I'll pass in

a dictionary with a content of chunk. I'm

gonna run that. And I'll finally, I'm going to search

over the store. I'll say store

search. And I'll use that same term that I used in

the previous notebook that did not give us the very good result. So

I'll ask what happened with incident

2023 Q4011. And

I'm going to ask for the first three search results.

And then I'm going to print up the results very nicely just so we can interpret

them really well. We'll say for doc, distance

in results. And I'll print out the distance,

a new line, doc with

content. And again, I'm only going to print out the first 200 lines.

And then how about a new line, a couple of separators

in another new line. I'm going to run this and

we'll see what we get. All right, so that's a

much better search result than what we had before. Now

I'm going to see software engineering first and then cybersecurity

after that and then methodology down here. So

now I am actually prioritizing the sections that use the most

important search term inside my query, which was the

incident 2023. And you'll notice that

I don't really have quite as much importance around the other terms

like what happened with. Those aren't quite as

important terms, and they might be used several times inside

of the original report, so I would not weigh those as heavily

in the output results. But this incident 2023,

that's a very rare term inside

of a report, so it should definitely have a much higher weighting.

And we can see that reflected very clearly inside of our search

results. All right, so now,

at this point in time, we have two separate search

systems. We have semantic search put together, and

we have this kind of more lexical, a little bit more classic

text search system. And you might notice that

in the implementation of these two stores, Back

up here in the cell right here, I put them together with

a rather similar API. They both have

a add document function and they both have a search

function down here as well. So now

that we have these two separate search systems, one

which implements semantic search and one which implements

lexical search, we're going to come back in the next video and

we're going to merge these two search systems together.

Whenever a user submits a query, we're going to forward it off

to both of these different search systems. We're going

to get back a set of results from both and we're going

to merge those results together. And hopefully we'll

have all the best outcomes of semantic search along

with some of the more classic results of lexical

search as well.
