# Response streaming

## Transcript

I want to think back to the original chat interface example that we

looked at earlier on inside this section. So remember, the

thought process here is that we've got a chat window running inside of

a web app or a mobile app. A user is going to enter a question.

That's going to be submitted to our server. We're thinking of stuff that into

a user message and send it off to Claude. Claude is

then going to send us back an assistant message. We

are going to extract the text from it and send it back down to our

mobile app or web app. And hopefully, that content

is going to appear on the screen. Now, this all sounds

pretty straightforward and easy at this point in time, but

there's one little issue here that we haven't really addressed

just yet. You see, the time between sending

that user message to Claude and then eventually getting an assistant

message back can very easily take a lot more

time than we expect. In some cases, it might

take 10 seconds or all the way up to 30 seconds

depending upon the size of the input user message

and the output assistant message. Now during

this entire time that the user is waiting for a response, we

could just show a spinner on the screen. But that's

not really a great user experience. Most users'

expectations are that whenever they enter in some kind of initial

message, like what is quantum computing, they

should almost immediately start to see some response

up here on the screen. To get this better user

experience, we are going to use a technique known as streaming.

So let me tell you a little bit about how streaming works. Our

server is still going to send an initial user message off

to Claude, but then Claude is going to almost immediately

send back an initial response to us. This

initial response doesn't actually contain any text content.

Instead, it is really just a sign to our server that Claude

has received our initial request and that Claude is about

to start to generate some amount of text. We are then going

to start to receive a stream of events. We're going to

go into a lot of detail around exactly what these events

are, but right now, just understand that they contain

pieces of the generated response that we want to send

back and eventually display to our users. The number

of events that we receive depends upon how much text we are

generating. Each event is going to contain just a little

bit of the overall message that is being generated. So

maybe the first event just has the text, quantum, and

then the second one says computing, and the third one is, and

so on. Now each event doesn't just contain one

word. It might contain many words, or even in entire

sentence. It really just depends upon how much time

it takes for Claude to generate each little bit of text.

Now, as I mentioned, our server is going to receive these events

and our server can optionally take the text out of each

event and immediately send it back down to our web

app or mobile app or whatever else where we can display

that little chunk of text on the screen. We can then repeat

this process for each additional event that we

receive on our server. So the net effect is that a

user is going to start to see some text, start to appear

chunk by chunk in the chat interface. Let's

now go back over to our notebook and we're going to write out a little bit of code

to better understand how streaming works. All

right, so back inside of my notebook, I still have these three helper

functions put together. Now, we are going to ignore

the chat function inside of this video, because

when we start to use streaming, it doesn't work quite so well with

the chat function as we have implemented it. So

I'm going to instead, down here, make a list of messages,

and then manually call the clientmessages.create

function. So I'm going to make an empty list

of messages. I'll add in a user message

to messages. And I'm going to ask Claude to write

a one sentence description of a fake

database. I'm then going

to call client messages create.

I will pass in the name of the model. Still

need to provide a max tokens. Provide

our list of messages. And then finally,

we'll put in an additional keyword argument here of stream is

true. And this is going to give us back not

a final answer, but instead we're going to get a stream

of different events. We can iterate through this thing

because it is a normal iterator. So we can say for event

in stream and then print out event.

Now, if I run this, we're going to very quickly see a stream

of different events up here on screen. So each

of these represents a different little chunk of data that is

being sent back to us by Claude. You'll notice that

we start off with a event named raw message store

event. We then get a raw content block

start, a raw content block delta.

We get several of those as a matter of fact. And

then, down towards the bottom, we eventually get a content

block stop event, a message delt

event, any message stop event. So

these are all events that are being sent back to us inside

of the context of a single request, all coming from

Claude. Each of these different events has some meaning

in the context of the overall response that we are getting back from

Claude. However, there is one event type

that we usually care about a little bit more than all the others, and

that is the raw, content block Delta

event. This event is what contains the actual

text that is being generated by Claude and sent back

to us chunk by chunk. In practice,

we usually end up getting the same sequence of events over

and over. So when we get a response back from Claude, we're almost

always going to start off with getting a message start, then

a content block start, and then we are going to get a sequence

of content block deltas. And again, those are

what contain the actual text. So we usually want to

collect all those different events and extract the text from them

and send that text back down to our web app or mobile

app or whatever else we are using. Now, back inside

of our notebook, inside this for loop right here, we could

add in a check to take a look and figure out what

kind of event we are dealing with. And then if it is one

of those raw content block delta events, we could

reach into it and get the text we actually care about. But that

would require a lot of extra code from us. Thankfully,

the Anthropic SDK exposes a different

way of creating a stream than what I'm showing to you right

here. This alternative way of creating a stream,

which I'm going to show you in just one moment, makes it a lot easier

to just get the text out of the response. And again,

the text is usually the part of the response that we really

care about. So let me show you an alternative way of

streaming a response. I'm going to go down

to the next code cell. So down here, I'm

going to again make a list of messages, add

a user message with

a write a one sentence description

of a fake database. And

then we're going to call a slightly different function and wrap it

inside of a with block. So say with

client messages dot stream.

And inside of here, we will again put in our model, our

max tokens, and

our messages. But

we do not need to add in the stream to true argument.

We'll then say as stream, colon, all

then indent, and inside of here, it will say for textinstream.textstream,

like so. So now text is gonna be

just the text part of those different events. So just

the text we actually care about, again, that's almost always the

thing that we actually really care about when we are streaming our response

from clot. Now to show you how this actually works,

I'm going to add in a print statement and log

out that text. I'm going to add in a end true

of empty string. And true of empty string, just make

sure that these print statements are not going to add in a new line

character to the end of the print statement. So we'll see each bit

of text logged out next to each other. Now

I'm going to run this and it's going to occur really quickly,

but you'll see that now we are getting a response streamed

back to us chunk by chunk. So let me do that again.

So run again. I'll see chunk, chunk, chunk. There

we go. You'll notice that each chunk contains multiple

different words. So again, we're not guaranteed to

just get back one single word inside of each event.

We might get several. There is one last feature here that

I want to show you. Now, as I've mentioned, we very

often want to stream a response back to a mobile app or

a web app so that a user can see each chunk

of text appear on the screen as soon as possible. But

something else we very often want to do after completing a stream

is take the entire message and maybe store it inside of a database.

So we have a record of the entire conversation that was had

with a particular user. Let me show you how we can collect

all these different events and present them all assembled

together inside of one single final message.

I'm going to replace this print statement right here with a

pass, just so we don't have any printing there. And

then after it, I'll do a stream.getfinalmessage.

And now if I run this again, we are still streaming back

a response and we could print it if we wanted to, but

we're also going to take all the individual events

we get back and assemble them together into one final

message, which we could then store inside the database or do

whatever else we need to do with it.
