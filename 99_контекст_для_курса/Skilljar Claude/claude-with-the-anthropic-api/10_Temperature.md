# Temperature

## Transcript

Earlier on inside this course, we spoke very briefly

about how Claude actually generates text. Remember,

we feed some amount of text into Claude, like the

words, what do you think. Claude is then going to tokenize

this text or break it up into smaller chunks. Claude

is then going to go through a prediction phase where it decides

what possible words could come next and assign

a probability to each of those different options.

Finally, in the sampling phase, a token is

actually chosen based upon these probabilities. So

in this diagram I have on the screen, given inputs of

what do you think possible next tokens

might be about, wood, and

so on. Everything you see here on the right-hand side. Each

of these gets assigned a probability. And then maybe

in this case, Claude settles on about as

being the best possible next token. So

we would end up with a phrase, what do you think about?

This entire process is then repeated to complete

the sentence or complete the entire message. Now

just to make sure things are really clear, the numbers I'm

showing here are probabilities, the percentage

chance of each token being selected. And

just to make things a little bit more clear with these probabilities, I'm

going to display them in a chart for the rest of this

video. So still the same probability is just in a

format that's easier for us to understand. You

also notice I've kind of sorted them from left to right. There's

no actual internal sorting going on. I'm just sorting

them greatest to these probability just

to make this chart a little bit easier to understand. So

now that we have a reminder on how Claude generates text,

I want to show you one way that we can directly influence

these probabilities and control which

token Claude might actually decide to select.

So we can control these probabilities using a parameter

called temperature. Temperature is a decimal

value between 0 and 1 that we provide

when we make our model call. So whenever we call

that converse function, temperature is going

to influence the exact distribution of probabilities.

This is a little bit tricky to understand. So you can look at the plot

or these charts I've got right here. Or alternatively, I put

together a quick little demo with plot itself just

to give you a better idea of what's going on. So let me show you that demo.

Okay, so this is the same chart we were just looking at in that diagram

a moment ago. Whenever we provide a temperature

value going down to zero, as you'll see, I got

temperature right here, the highest probability

becomes more likely to occur. So

our highest probability was about, and it's going

to increase all the way up to 100%. So

at temperatures of zero, we start to get what we call a deterministic

output, where we always select the token that has the highest

initial probability. Then, as we start to increase

our temperature, it increases the chances of us selecting

a token that has a lower initial probability.

So we go from maybe having a 0% chance of

selecting we as the next token,

although it to say 9%. So this is the theory

behind temperature, but what does this actually mean in the real

world? Well, we start to use different values of temperature,

given the actual task that we're trying to complete. These

are some example ranges and tasks that might fit

into each sample range. For something like, say,

data extraction, we really don't want a lot of randomness

or creativity. If we give Claude a big chunk

of text and ask it to extract very specific pieces

of information, no real creativity required

there whatsoever. We just want Claude to look at the exact

text we provided and pull out the most relevant information.

And then on the higher temperature side, this is where we start to get more

creative. And we start to see less common

tokens being used. We probably are

going to want to use higher temperatures anytime we are doing any

kind of really creative focus task, such as brainstorming,

writing, maybe doing some really creative marketing, or

something like a joke where a lot of jokes really depend

upon using words in ways that are not

always quite expected. Now that we understand what temperature

is all about, let's go back over to our notebook and understand how we can

adjust temperature on the fly. I would like to update our

chat function so that it takes in a temperature argument

that we're going to pass through to our create function call. So

inside of the list of arguments, I'm going to add in temperature

and I'm going to default my temperature to be 1.0. So

I want to fall on the more creative side of things. Then

I'm going to take in that argument and add it into the Params

object as temperature. And

that's all we have to do to add in support for adjusting

the temperature inside of our application. So now to

test this out, I'm going to rerun this cell. I'm

then going to go down to the next cell, and I'm going to ask

Claude to generate a one sentence

movie idea. And initially, I'm

going to provide a temperature of 0.0.

So now in theory, I should be getting back movie ideas

that always tend to be a little bit similar in nature.

So I'm going to run this. And

the first time, I'm going to get back a time-traveling archeologist.

You're going to see that this is a very common pattern, at

least for me. I very often, when I have a temperature of zero, get

movie ideas that are about a time-traveling something.

So if I run this again, I'm probably going to see another time-traveling

thing. Yep, same thing. Maybe one more time.

And yeah, same kind of idea, a jaded

time-traveling historian. Let's now try adjusting

our temperature a little bit to hopefully encourage Claude to give us some more

original or creative ideas. I'm going to try adjusting

my temperature up to 1.0. Now

if I run this again, I hopefully will not get an idea

about a jaded time traveler or something like that. And

almost immediately you can see that I do. So this is something

to be aware of. Just because you dial up the temperature

doesn't mean you're always going to get dramatically different ideas.

It just increases the chances of getting a different one. So

if I run this again, I might end up seeing out more creative idea.

Okay, that's definitely more creative. Nothing about time travel this

time and be one more test year. And

there we go, again, not about a time traveler or

anything like that. All right, so that is temperature.

Now remember, there's some general guidance here. Whenever

we are doing tasks that require less creativity, or whenever

we want to have a very deterministic output, we want to use

that lower temperature value. And whenever we have a

task that requires a little bit more creativity, that's when

we want to start to think about dialing up the temperature

a little bit.
