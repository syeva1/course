# Multi-Turn conversations

## Transcript

The code we've written out so far simulates a very simple

exchange with our model. And we can kind of visualize this conversation

inside of a chat box like this. We sent in

a request asking something like what's quantum computing,

answer in one sentence. And we got a very simple

single sentence reply. Naturally, we might want

to continue this conversation at some point in time. So

we might want to be able to send in a follow up asking something

like write another sentence. And we

would then expect to get back a response that expands on

quantum computing in some way. To have a multi-message

conversation like this, there's something really critical that you

need to understand around the Anthropic API and Claude

itself. And that is that the Anthropic API

and Claude do not store any messages that you

send to it. None of the messages you send get

stored in any way, and none of the responses

that you get back are stored in any way. So if you

ever want to have some kind of conversation going on, where

you have multiple messages that kind of maintain a context

or flow, then there are two things that you need to

do. You need to manually, inside of your

code, maintain a list of all the messages that you are

exchanging. And second, you need to make sure that

you provide that entire list of messages with every follow-up

request that you make. So let's go into some detail

on this entire idea, just make sure it's really clear and

you understand what's going on here. The first thing I want to

do is write out a little bit of sample code just to prove to you

that Claude doesn't store any messages or anything

like that. And I can prove this by trying to simulate this

kind of conversation where I first ask what quantum computing

is and then ask right another sentence.

So back inside of my notebook, I'm going to go to the cell where I initially

asked what is quantum computing. And I want to paste

in a second request to Claude that

I wrote out ahead of time. So in this second request,

I'm asking Claude to write another sentence, and

I'm going to print out the text inside of that follow-up

request. So now we've kind of got a simulation

of what's going on right here, where we ask that first question and

then send in a follow-up. And we're going to see that we don't get

back any kind of legible or any usable

text here. So I'm going to run this and we'll see what happens.

So back over here, I'm going to run that cell now and we're going to see that

we get back something that has absolutely nothing to do with

quantum computing at all. So again, to make sure

that it's really clear why we are seeing this result and

not seeing something about quantum computing, let's go over

a couple of diagrams. All right, so in

this diagram, I'm going to first show you exactly what's going on with

the query code that I've written out, where we are getting back a response

that has nothing to do with quantum computing. So

initially, I make a similar quest to Claude, where I have

one user message, and I'm asking Claude to define quantum

computing in one sentence. I then get back a response

that is exactly what I would expect. Claude

gives me back a one-sense definition of quantum computing.

Then I make a second request where I have only

one message inside the body. And the only message is

asking Claude to write another sentence. When

I send this in, Claude has no memory of any past conversation

or any previous messages that I exchanged with it. So

Claude is just going to do the best it can to fulfill

my request. It's going to write out some sentence, but

it definitely is probably not going to be about quantum

computing. So now let me show you what

we need to do to fix this problem. Here's how we're

going to solve the issue. First, we're going to

once again make that initial request with just one user

message. Then we're going to take that assistant message

that we get back and append it into a list

of messages. So we're going to take the assistant right there and we can

imagine we're going to add it into our list on the left-hand

side. Then, when we want to follow

up on this conversation or continue it in some way, we're

going to append on a user message at the bottom.

So now we can read this as like a real conversation. I

asked to find quantum computing, I got back a response,

and now I'm adding in another question or another

query that I want to ask Claude. In this case, write

another sentence. Now when I send

in this list of messages to Claude, it will have the entire

context and history of the whole conversation. It's

seen all the previous messages that we've exchanged around

this line of questioning. And hopefully, Claude

will be able to give us back a more reasonable answer, hopefully

a one sentence follow up that's going to extend its previous

answer a little bit more. To see this entire flow

in action, I'm going to go back over to my notebook and we're going to try to write

out some code that will allow us to maintain the full

context for a conversation. Back

inside of my notebook, I'm going to get started by making three

different helper functions that are going to aid us in

maintaining the history or context of a conversation.

We're going to end up using these helper functions quite a bit throughout the

remainder of this course. So in this cell right

here, I'm going to give myself a little bit of space at the top and

then define our first helper function that will aid

us in maintaining this history. I'm going to name this

function add user message. It's

going to take in a list of messages and some text.

I'm then going to make a variable of user message. That's

going to have a role of user and

some content of whatever text we pass in. And

then I'm going to append this new user message into the

list of messages. Next,

I'm going to add in a second helper function that's going to specialize

in adding in assistant messages to a history.

So I'm going to copy this function right here just to save a little bit of time.

I'll rename it to add assistant message.

And I'll go through and wherever I see the word user, I'm

gonna change it out to assistant. So right there, right

there, and right there. Okay,

now onto our third helper function. I'm

going to take our messages.create function call

down here. And I'm going to rename it to chat.

Whenever I call chat, I'm gonna pass in a list of messages.

So this is gonna be like my message history. Then

I'm going to indent our call right here.

I'm going to replace messages with the Messages argument,

and then return from this function is going to be message

content at zero dot text. All

right, so here are the three helper functions. And

again, we're going to use these quite a bit throughout the remainder of this entire

course. These helper functions are going to make it significantly

easier for us to have a conversation that maintains some

history or context over time. So now let

me give you a demonstration of how we're going to put them to use.

All right, so down here in the next cell down, I'm gonna write in a

couple of comments that she's gonna guide us through the process of

maintaining a conversation that has some history tied

to it. I'll first begin by making an empty

list of messages. So this message is variable

right here, we can imagine is storing our entire conversation

history. Over time, we're gonna add in a collection

of different user and assistant messages to it.

Next, I'm going to add in my initial user message.

So I will call the add user message function.

I'll pass in the list of messages that I'm appending messages

to, and then my user text is

going to be define quantum computing in one sentence. Now,

just to make sure we're going down the right path here, I'm going to print

out the list of messages and run the cell.

And we can see right away that we have a correct structure

of messages. So I have a list. It has a dictionary

inside of it with a role of user and a content that

contains something that I want to feed into Claude. So

now we can easily call Claude by making use of that chat

function that we just put together. I'm going to call chat and

pass in my list of messages. And then out of that, we'll

get back some kind of answer. I'm going to print out

the answer and run the cell again. So

we get the response, we should see a sentence here

about quantum computing. So now we are in this

situation. We have sent an initial message into

Claude and gotten an assistant message back in response.

Now we need to take this answer and append it into our

conversation history. So we need to add in or

append it in by making use of the add assistant message

function that we just defined. So back

over here. I'm going to call add assistant

message. I want to add into our list of messages

and I want to add in specifically the content out

of the answer that we just got back. So now let's

do another check and make sure that our list of messages is

looking correct. If I print out messages,

I should see my user message, then the followup assistant

with the content that we got back from Claude. Okay, so that

looks good. So now onto the last step. We're

going to append in one last user message and

send the entire conversation history into Claude once

again. So for that, I'll

do another add user message with

my list of messages. And then my followup question here or my

followup request is going to be write another

sentence. I'm then going to call

chat again with the updated

list of messages. I'll assign that to

answer, and then I will print answer out. So

let's now run this and see how we are doing. All

right, after a brief pause, we get what is definitely

a follow-up message that is definitely still

about quantum computing. And so it appears that we have correctly maintained

our entire conversation history. All

right, so this is looking pretty good. We now have three reusable

helper functions that we're going to continue to make use of throughout

the remainder of the course.
