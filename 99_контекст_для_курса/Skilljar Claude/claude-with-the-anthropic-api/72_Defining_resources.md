# Defining resources

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to move on to the next major feature inside

of MCP servers, which is Resources. To

help you understand resources, we're going to be implementing another

feature inside of our project. Here's what we're going to add in.

I want to allow a user to mention a document

by putting in an add symbol and then the name of a document.

Whenever they do so, I want to automatically fetch the

contents of that document and insert it into the prompt

that we send off to Claude. So in total, there's kind

of two aspects to this feature. Whenever user types

out the at symbol inside the message, we're going to automatically

show a list of all the different documents that they can mention

inside of a little autocomplete window. Then whenever

user submits a message with a mention inside of

it, we're going to automatically get the contents of that document

and insert it into the prompt that we send off to Claude.

So for example, if a user says something like what's

in the atchreport.pdf file, I

would want to assemble a prompt like this and send it to Claude.

So we're going to have the query inside there from the user, and

then we're also going to tell Claude that the user might have referenced

some document, and here is the contents of the document.

So the approach here or the idea here is that we will

not have to rely upon Claude to go and make

use of some tool to figure out what is inside of the

report.pdf file. Instead, the user can just

preemptively mention the file, and we're going to automatically

insert some context ahead of time. Now, one thing I

want to clarify here is that we're kind of talking about two

separate features. The first feature is that whenever

a user types in the at symbol, we really need

the MCVP server to give us a list of all the

different documents that the user can possibly mention.

And then the second aspect here is that whenever a

user submits a message that contains a mention, then

we need the MCP server to give us the contents of a single

document. To get this information out of our MCP server,

we are going to be making use of resources. Resources

allow our MCP server to expose some amount

of data to the client. We usually define one resource

for each distinct read operation. So in

our example, we need to get a list of documents and

read the contents of a single document. So we would

probably end up making two separate resources. One

resource would be responsible for returning just a list

of document names so we can put them inside the autocomplete,

and then we would probably make another resource that will expose

the contents of a single document based upon its

document ID. When we define these

resources, they are going to be accessed through our MCP

client. So the entire flow that we're going to eventually

put together here, whenever user types in something

like what's in the app and then presumably

they're going to put in something right there, as soon as they type in that app

character, we need to display a list of document

names to put in the auto complete. So our

code is going to reach out to the MCP client,

which in turn is going to send a read resource

request off to the MCP server.

Inside of that read resource request, we're going to include

something called the URI. That is essentially

the address of the resource we want to read.

This URI gets defined whenever we put together

our resource initially. So the URI is that

right there. When we send

off this read resource request, the MCP

server is going to look at the exact URI that we put inside

of here, and then run the function we

put together right there. Take the result and

send it back to us inside of a read resource

result message. We can then take the data

inside there and display it inside of our autocomplete or do

whatever else we need to do with it. There are two different

types of resources, direct and templated. You'll

also sometimes see direct resources referred to as static

resources. A direct resource just has

a static URI, so it's always going to be the exact

same thing, such as docs, colon slash slash documents.

A templated resource will have one or more parameters

inside of its URI. So for example, we might have documents

slash, and then kind of a wild card right here. So

we can put in any document ID we want to. And

whenever we ask for this resource, that document

ID right there inside the URI will be automatically parsed

by the Python MCP SDK and

provided as a keyword argument to our function.

The keyword argument will have the exact same name of whatever

string you put in right there. So Doc ID right there will

be Doc ID right there. As

you can probably guess, we'll make use of templated resources anytime

that we want to allow a little bit more selection or variety

or customization in what someone is asking for

out of our MCP server. Implementing resources

is pretty straightforward. So let's go back over to our editor and we're

going to add in some resources to our server right away.

All right, so back over inside my editor, I will find the MCP

server.py file. I'm then going to scroll down a

little bit and I'm going to find some comments for writing

a resource to return all document IDs and

writing a resource to return the contents of a particular

document. Now for this first one right here, I

put in the comment document IDs. Remember

for us, our document IDs are essentially the

name of the document. So for us, we're really just returning

these IDs. They're going to serve the purpose of the name. That

means we can put them directly into that autocomplete element.

All right, so to make our resource, I'm going to delete

that to do. and then I'll add in a MCP.resource.

The first argument is going to be the URI for accessing

this thing. Again, it's kind of equivalent to a route handler.

So I will use docs, colon slash

slash documents, and I'm also going

to add in a MIME type of application

slash JSON. A resource can

return any type of data, so it can be plain text,

it can be JSON, it can be binary data, anything.

is up to us to kind of give our client a hint

as to what kind of data we are returning. To do

so, we're going to define this MIME type. A MIME

type of application slash JSON is a hint to

our client, who's eventually going to ask for this resource

right here, that we're going to be sending back a string that

contains some structured JSON data. And

so it would be up to our client to de-serialize

that data, or essentially turn it into some usable data

structure. Underneath that decorator, I'll

write out my function of list docs, and

I'm going to return a list of strings. And

then inside there, I will return list docs

keys. So just take all the keys out of that dictionary and

turn it into a list, and I'm going to return it. Now,

you'll notice that we are not returning distinct JSON here.

In other words, we're not actually returning a string. The MCP

Python SDK is going to automatically take whatever we return

and turn it into a string for us. All

right, let's take care of our second resource. So I'm going

to delete that comment and then replace it with MCP

resource, docs, colon

slash slash documents. And then this time I

want a templated resource because I'm putting in this

wildcard right here. And

then my mind type this time around, just for a little

bit of variety, I'm going to be returning plain

text because it's going to be just the contents of the document.

And I'm not going to wrap it up in any kind of structure. Now,

just so you know, in a real application, something

like read a document, I would probably return

an entire document record. So some kind of

dictionary that contains maybe the ID, the

content, the author name, the author ID, and

stuff like that. But just for the sake of an example, I'm

going to return just the text at the document to show

you how we would normally return plain text. So

in this scenario, my MIME type would be text plane,

and then I will make fetch doc.

I'm going to take doc ID, which is going to be a string,

and I'm going to return a string. Once again, whatever

word you put right there, it's going to show up as a

keyword argument inside of your function. If we

added in some additional parameters inside of here, such

as maybe doc type or something like that, it would

just show up as an additional keyword argument

like so. Then

inside of here, I'm going to first make sure that the ID that this person

is asking for actually exists. So if doc

ID not in docs, I'm

going to raise a value error with

a F string that says doc with ID not

found. And then if we get past that check, I'll

return docs doc ID. And

that's it. Now let's try testing this stuff out inside

of our MCP Inspector once again. So

remember at our terminal, we can run the command UVRun,

MCPDev, MCPServer.py.

That's going to start up a web server at port 6277

or see me 6274 as the default. So I'm going

to make sure I open that up inside my browser. Here

we go. I'll click connect. I'll then find

resources. And then I should be able to list

out all the different resources that are available. Now when

I list out resources, this is going to be specifically static

or direct resources. So I'll see only docs

slash documents. And then I can separately list

out all my different resource templates. And so I'll see

that I have one resource template of FetchDoc.

I can first try to run the slash documents

right here. We'll see what we get back. So this

is the actual message, the exact structure that

gets returned from our MCP server. You'll

notice that it has a text property and inside there is all

the data that we are returning serialized as JSON

string. So again, it would be up to us inside

of our CLI application to take this text right here and

deserialize it from this JSON string into

a usable list of strings. Then

we can also test out fetch doc. So I'll click on that.

I have to enter a doc ID. So I'm going to put it in.

I want to read the report.pdf

file. And I'll read

the resource. And now I should see the contents

of that particular document. And you'll notice this

I'm around. Once again, I get a text plain. So that's

a hint to me that this is plain text. And I should

not attempt to deserialize it from JSON in

any way.
