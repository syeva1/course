# Model based grading

## Transcript

The next thing we're going to implement inside of our prompt evaluation

workflow is a grading system. As a

reminder, a grader is going to take in some output coming

from our model. And then our hope is that the grader

is going to give us some kind of objective signal. It might

be a number or a true or false value. It could

be really anything, but very commonly, very frequently,

you're going to see a number output between 1 and

10. where 10 means that we got a very high quality

output, and one means we got a very low quality output.

Again, that's not a requirement. We don't have to get numbers

out of these graders, but it's a very common practice

that you're going to see very often. There's three

different kinds of graders that we're going to discuss in this video.

Code, model, and human. Let's first

figure out what code-based graders are all about.

With a code-based grader, we're going to take the output from our model

and feed it into a snippet of code that you and I author. Inside

this code, we can do just about any kind of programmatic

check you can imagine. So we might verify to

make sure that the output from the model was not too long

or too short. We might make sure that the output does

have or doesn't have certain words. If we are returning

JSON or code, we can do syntax validation

programmatically, and we can even do more complex

checks like implement a readability score, where

we make sure that the generated text is at an

appropriate reading level for our particular use

case. The only requirement here is that when

we run this code, we return some kind of actual

signal we can use. And again, usually that's going to be a number

between 1 and 10, but that is not a requirement.

The next kind of grader that you're going to see very often is

a model-based grader. This is where we take the

output from our original model call, so the one that we

already made, and we feed it into an additional

model. So this is another API request. When

we use a model grader, we get a tremendous amount of

flexibility. We can ask a model to evaluate a response

based upon its general quality, maybe how well it

followed prompt instructions, maybe the completeness

of the response, really just about anything you can imagine. Once

again, the only real requirement here is that the model gives us

back some kind of hard objective signal, usually

as a number between one and 10. And then finally,

human-based grading. With human-based grading,

we're going to take all the outputs from our model and then put them in front

of an actual person. This person is

then going to be in charge of evaluating these responses in

some particular way. As you can imagine, humans are very

flexible, so we can ask them to evaluate responses in just

about any fashion or for any metric you can possibly imagine.

The one big downside to human-based grading is that it generally

does take a lot of time, and it's certainly very tedious

work. Now, no matter what style of grading you are using,

you need to decide upfront what your evaluation

criteria is going to be. So in other words, exactly

what aspects of these responses are you going to

be focusing on? For our particular use case,

I've centered on three different evaluation criteria.

I think first off, we should evaluate the responses

to make sure that we're only getting back Python, JSON,

or regular expression without any additional explanation

being provided by Claude. Secondly,

whenever we get that Python JSON or regex, we

should make sure that it has some valid syntax so that

there should be no typos in there or anything like that. And

then finally, we should probably do some general task following

and make sure that the model clearly addressed

the user's task and answered it with some generally

accurate code that doesn't contain any major errors

or logic mistakes. So for these three

different evaluation criteria, I think we can evaluate

the first two with a code grader. So

we can evaluate the format and make sure we got actual

Python JSON or regex with code. And

we can also validate the syntax of that

code using well, additional code. And

then finally, the general response and making

sure that the user's question was clearly addressed,

that would be more appropriate to address through a model grader

given its flexibility. All right,

let's start to implement first the model grader

because that's believe it or not can be the easiest one to put

together. I'm going to first begin by going back

over to my notebook. I'm

going to find that to do. We had put together right here inside of our

run test case function. And then

right above that cell, I'm going to add a new cell with

a function that I'm going to call grade by

model. And I'm going to assume that I'm going to pass

in my test case dictionary.

Remember, the test case dictionary is essentially these

objects right here. Each of these data set values,

these are our test cases. I'm

also going to pass in the output from our original model

call. And then inside

of here, we're going to essentially make a call off

to a model and ask it to grade the output. So

for this, we usually end up writing a fairly long prompt.

And again, just to save us a little bit of time, I'm going to copy paste

a prompt in. So here we go. I'm

going to paste this in. And yes, it

is a little bit long, but this is kind of the bare minimum of

what we want. So this prompt is

going to set a role. It's then going to ask

very clearly for the model to evaluate a

AI generated solution. We're

then going to print out the task. We're

then going to list out the solution that was generated

by the model. And then we're going to provide

some directions on exactly how to respond. In

this particular case, I'm asking the model to give me a list of

strengths and weaknesses of the AI generated

solution, along with some reasoning behind that and

an actual score. Now we could just ask

for a score by itself, but if you do so, you're

gonna see very often you tend to get scores of just six.

So if you don't ask for any additional strengths or weaknesses

or reasoning, you're gonna very often just get very middling

scores because the model kind of assumes, well, could

be better, could be worse, we'll give it a six. By

asking the model to provide some reasoning, strengths and weaknesses,

you really make it hone in and decide upon a more concrete

score. So now that

we have that prompt in here, I'm going to call

our additional grading model. So

right underneath it, I'll again make a messages list.

I'll add in a user message. And

then because we are getting back some JSON here, we

need to once again, make sure we extract that cleanly by

using a pre-filled assistant message and a stop

sequence. So we'll add a assistant

message. with `json`

JSON, and

then I'll get back some eval text, and

we'll call chat with messages and a stop

sequence or stop sequences of, once

again, closing `json`. Now

this eval text should be a JSON object

with this kind of structure right here. So I'm going to

parse that and just return it. So return

a JSON dot loads with

eval text.

Okay, so that is our model grader. That's really

all it takes to at least get started. So now

we need to make sure we actually call this grader to

call the grader. I'll go down to our to do right here.

I'm going to replace score with model grade.

And that's going to be coming from our grade by model

function. And remember, we have to pass in the

test case, along with the output from

actually running the prompt. And

then from this, we're going to get a score from

model grade. And

I'm also going to extract from that dictionary that gets returned the

reasoning behind the score. Inside

of this model grade dictionary that we are returning,

there is also going to be the strengths and weaknesses

list. You could definitely extract those as well as you want, but

I'm just going to keep our example a little bit more concise. I'm

going to take the score and reasoning and put them into this

final output dictionary. So

I will add in some additional keys here of

score. Oh, I already have score right there. My mistake.

I don't need that, but I do need reasoning.

And that

will be reasoning. Okay,

so that looks good. I'm not going to make sure I run

these cells. I'm going to run that one, update

run test case. And

then I'm going to rerun my

actual evaluation. That is going to take

a while to complete. For me, it takes about 22 seconds

this time around. And now if I print out

those results, let's see what we get. So

I've now got the generated output here. And if I scroll down a

little bit, I can take a look at the score

that was generated by the model and some reasoning behind

that score. So in this case, I got an eight. That's

not bad. And that's why I got the eight. And

if I keep going down, the next one got a seven. And

then finally, I got a six. So the last thing

we would probably want to do here is take all these scores,

add them together, get an average, and print that out.

So we get a final, very objective score to tell

us how well our prompt is currently functioning.

So to average all these scores out and print

the results, I'm going to find the run eval function

right here. And I will calculate the average

score with a comprehension

of result score for

result in results. And I'm going to wrap that

with a mean function call. And

then I will import the mean function from

the statistics package. One

last step. Let's make sure we actually print out that average score. We'll

do a print. average

score like so. All right,

now I'm going to run this code just one more time to make sure everything

is working as expected. And

after it runs, I see that I do get, in fact, an average score

of 7.33. And once again, this gives

us finally an actual objective metric. Yeah,

it's being graded by a model that might be a little bit capricious sometimes.

And maybe we could give better guidance on how to grade things, but at least

we have a score that we can start to focus on and try to

increase.
