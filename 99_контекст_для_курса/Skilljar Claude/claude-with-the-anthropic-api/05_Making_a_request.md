# Making a request

## Transcript

We have done quite a bit of talking, so in this video, we're going

to change things and get our hands dirty by writing out a little

bit of code. We're going to learn how to make a simple and basic

request off to the Anthropic API. I'm going to walk you

through four setup steps. So step one, we're

going to open up a Jupyter notebook and install the Anthropic

Python SDK, along with a package called python-dotenv.

To get started, I'm going to open up a notebook on my own. I've

already added in some comments to my notebook just to guide myself

through this process. In step one up here, I'm going

to add in a magic install command, so percent,

pip, install, anthropic, python-dotenv.

If you're writing your notebook inside of Visual Studio Code as

I am, you might notice a red syntax error coming

from the percent over here. If you see that syntax error, it

is totally fine. You can ignore it. Once I've written

out this command, I'm going to run it to install these packages.

I'm then going to clear the output just so you can see what's going on my

screen a little bit more easily. Next, we are going to use

that python-dotenv package to store

and load our API key. As a reminder,

I put in some directions on creating API key in the previous

lecture. So if you did not create an API key, I would

encourage you to go back to the previous lecture and find those

directions. To store this key inside

of my editor, I'm going to create a file in the same directory

as my notebook with a very special name. I'm going to name this file.env.

And then inside of here, I'm going to place the API key that I

generated a moment ago. I will write out exactly

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,

and then an equal sign. And then inside of double quotes,

I will put in that key. As a quick side note, the whole

reason that we are creating this file and putting our key inside of here is

so that we can now ignore this file when we are making use

of version control. So that we do not accidentally

commit this file, say, to git, and then accidentally

push it up to some public repository where anyone can see

this file. So again, if you're making use of Git or a similar

version control system, I would encourage you to make sure that you

ignore this file any time you are committing your work. Now,

back inside of my notebook, I can securely load up that

environment variable. Then, onto step number three,

where we will create our API client using the Anthropic

package. Inside the cell, I'm also going to declare

a variable name model. This will be a string. It's going to contain

the name of the model that we want to run inside

of the Anthropic API. We are going to use

Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Now onto the

last step, where we are going to actually make a request using

that client that we just created. Before we write

out any code, however, I want to show you a little bit of terminology,

just some stuff that's going to make things a little bit easier down the

line. So the first thing to understand here is that

we are going to access Claude by using the create function

inside the Anthropic SDK. This function requires

three different keyword arguments, a model, max

tokens, and messages. The model keyword

argument is just going to be the name of the model we want to run. We

already defined that variable ahead of time in our previous

cell. The second required keyword argument is

max_tokens. This sets

a maximum budget on a number of tokens that Claude

can generate. For example, if we pass in a max

tokens of 1000, if Claude tries to generate anything

longer than that, then the generation will be automatically

stopped, and we will receive back the first 1000

tokens that were generated. One thing to note

here is that Claude doesn't try to target your

number of max_tokens. In other words, Claude

won't try to write a response of 1000 tokens,

it'll just write whatever response it thinks is appropriate.

And as such, you should really view max_tokens as being

like a safety mechanism to ensure that you're not

generating too much text. Finally,

messages. And this is the part that I really want to focus on

because messages are going to be a huge focus for us in the coming

videos. To understand what messages are all

about, I would like you to think back to the chat application

we discussed a moment ago. So a user

might type in some question to Claude and then expect to get

an answer back. The messages

that we're talking about when we pass these things into this create

function are meant to represent exchanges like

this. There are two types of messages, a

user message and assistant message.

User messages contain text that we want to feed into

Claude. The content inside of a user message is

text that either a user or you and I as

developers have authored. In other words, a

user message will contain text that has been written by

some person. The second type of

message is an assistant message. These messages

contain text that have been produced by a model and

sent back to us. Now, at this point,

I think we have enough knowledge to at least make our

first request. So let's do that and then discuss

messages a little bit more. Back inside of my notebook,

in the very last cell, I'm going to declare a variable of message

that will come from client.messages.create

And I'm going to pass in those different arguments that we just discussed.

So I'll put in a model of model, a max_tokens,

and I'll use 1000 here, which I think is definitely a safe

limit, and then a list of input messages. So

inside here, I'm going to put in one single user message, and

it will contain my question or my query that I want to

send off to Claude. To create a user message,

we'll create a dictionary that will have a role

of user, and then a content that will

contain the actual string that we want to send into Claude.

So in this case, I'm going to ask Claude to define quantum computing

with something like what is quantum

computing answer in one sentence.

Then I'm going to run this and we'll take a moment or two

to run because we are actually accessing Claude here. And

then in the next cell down, I'm going to try to print out the message

variable. We'll see what we get. All

right, so inside of here, we can see that there's a lot of stuff coming

out, but noticeably, we have a definition

right around here of what quantum computing actually

is. So inside of this message variable that

we got back, our text is kind of deeply nested.

We very often want to get just the text that Claude has generated,

and very often we don't really care about any of these other properties that

are contained inside this thing. So to access

just the generated text, we would write out message.content[0].text

like so. And if I run that cell again, now I'll

see just the generated text and nothing else.
