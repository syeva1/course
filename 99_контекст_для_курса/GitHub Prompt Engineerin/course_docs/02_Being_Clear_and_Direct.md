## Setup

Run the following setup cell to load your API key and establish the `get_completion` helper function.

```python
%pip install anthropic

# Import python's built-in regular expression library
import re
import anthropic

# Retrieve the API_KEY & MODEL_NAME variables from the IPython store
%store -r API_KEY
%store -r MODEL_NAME

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)

# Note that we changed max_tokens to 4K just for this lesson to allow for longer completions in the exercises
def get_completion(prompt: str, system_prompt=""):
    message = client.messages.create(
        model=MODEL_NAME,
        max_tokens=4000,
        temperature=0.0,
        system=system_prompt,
        messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return message.content[0].text
```

## Lesson

**Claude responds best to clear and direct instructions.**

Think of Claude like any other human that is new to the job. **Claude has no context** on what to do aside from what you literally tell it. Just as when you instruct a human for the first time on a task, the more you explain exactly what you want in a straightforward manner to Claude, the better and more accurate Claude's response will be."				
				
When in doubt, follow the **Golden Rule of Clear Prompting**:
- Show your prompt to a colleague or friend and have them follow the instructions themselves to see if they can produce the result you want. If they're confused, Claude's confused.				

### Examples

Let's take a task like writing poetry. (Ignore any syllable mismatch - LLMs aren't great at counting syllables yet.)

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Write a haiku about robots."

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

This haiku is nice enough, but users may want Claude to go directly into the poem without the "Here is a haiku" preamble.

How do we achieve that? We **ask for it**!

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Write a haiku about robots. Skip the preamble; go straight into the poem."

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

Here's another example. Let's ask Claude who's the best basketball player of all time. You can see below that while Claude lists a few names, **it doesn't respond with a definitive "best"**.

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Who is the best basketball player of all time?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

Can we get Claude to make up its mind and decide on a best player? Yes! Just ask!

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Who is the best basketball player of all time? Yes, there are differing opinions, but if you absolutely had to pick one player, who would it be?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

## Exercises
- [Exercise 2.1 - Spanish](#exercise-21---spanish)
- [Exercise 2.2 - One Player Only](#exercise-22---one-player-only)
- [Exercise 2.3 - Write a Story](#exercise-23---write-a-story)

### Exercise 2.1 - Spanish
Modify the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to make Claude output its answer in Spanish.

```python
# System prompt - this is the only field you should change
SYSTEM_PROMPT = "[Replace this text]"

# Prompt
PROMPT = "Hello Claude, how are you?"

# Get Claude's response
response = get_completion(PROMPT, SYSTEM_PROMPT)

# Function to grade exercise correctness
def grade_exercise(text):
    return "hola" in text.lower()

# Print Claude's response and the corresponding grade
print(response)
print("\n--------------------------- GRADING ---------------------------")
print("This exercise has been correctly solved:", grade_exercise(response))
```

❓ If you want a hint, run the cell below!

```python
from hints import exercise_2_1_hint; print(exercise_2_1_hint)
```

### Exercise 2.2 - One Player Only

Modify the `PROMPT` so that Claude doesn't equivocate at all and responds with **ONLY** the name of one specific player, with **no other words or punctuation**. 

```python
# Prompt - this is the only field you should change
PROMPT = "[Replace this text]"

# Get Claude's response
response = get_completion(PROMPT)

# Function to grade exercise correctness
def grade_exercise(text):
    return text == "Michael Jordan"

# Print Claude's response and the corresponding grade
print(response)
print("\n--------------------------- GRADING ---------------------------")
print("This exercise has been correctly solved:", grade_exercise(response))
```

❓ If you want a hint, run the cell below!

```python
from hints import exercise_2_2_hint; print(exercise_2_2_hint)
```

### Exercise 2.3 - Write a Story

Modify the `PROMPT` so that Claude responds with as long a response as you can muster. If your answer is **over 800 words**, Claude's response will be graded as correct.

```python
# Prompt - this is the only field you should change
PROMPT = "[Replace this text]"

# Get Claude's response
response = get_completion(PROMPT)

# Function to grade exercise correctness
def grade_exercise(text):
    trimmed = text.strip()
    words = len(trimmed.split())
    return words >= 800

# Print Claude's response and the corresponding grade
print(response)
print("\n--------------------------- GRADING ---------------------------")
print("This exercise has been correctly solved:", grade_exercise(response))
```

❓ If you want a hint, run the cell below!

```python
from hints import exercise_2_3_hint; print(exercise_2_3_hint)
```

### Congrats!

If you've solved all exercises up until this point, you're ready to move to the next chapter. Happy prompting!

## Example Playground

This is an area for you to experiment freely with the prompt examples shown in this lesson and tweak prompts to see how it may affect Claude's responses.

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Write a haiku about robots."

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Write a haiku about robots. Skip the preamble; go straight into the poem."

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Who is the best basketball player of all time?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Who is the best basketball player of all time? Yes, there are differing opinions, but if you absolutely had to pick one player, who would it be?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```
