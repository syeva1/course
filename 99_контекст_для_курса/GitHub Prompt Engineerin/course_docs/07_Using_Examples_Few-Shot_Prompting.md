## Setup

Run the following setup cell to load your API key and establish the `get_completion` helper function.

```python
%pip install anthropic

# Import python's built-in regular expression library
import re
import anthropic

# Retrieve the API_KEY & MODEL_NAME variables from the IPython store
%store -r API_KEY
%store -r MODEL_NAME

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=API_KEY)

def get_completion(prompt: str, system_prompt="", prefill=""):
    message = client.messages.create(
        model=MODEL_NAME,
        max_tokens=2000,
        temperature=0.0,
        system=system_prompt,
        messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
          {"role": "assistant", "content": prefill}
        ]
    )
    return message.content[0].text
```

## Lesson

**Giving Claude examples of how you want it to behave (or how you want it not to behave) is extremely effective** for:
- Getting the right answer
- Getting the answer in the right format

This sort of prompting is also called "**few shot prompting**". You might also encounter the phrase "zero-shot" or "n-shot" or "one-shot". The number of "shots" refers to how many examples are used within the prompt.

### Examples

Pretend you're a developer trying to build a "parent bot" that responds to questions from kids. **Claude's default response is quite formal and robotic**. This is going to break a child's heart.

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = "Will Santa bring me presents on Christmas?"

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

You could take the time to describe your desired tone, but it's much easier just to **give Claude a few examples of ideal responses**.

```python
# Prompt
PROMPT = """Please complete the conversation by writing the next line, speaking as "A".
Q: Is the tooth fairy real?
A: Of course, sweetie. Wrap up your tooth and put it under your pillow tonight. There might be something waiting for you in the morning.
Q: Will Santa bring me presents on Christmas?"""

# Print Claude's response
print(get_completion(PROMPT))
```

In the following formatting example, we could walk Claude step by step through a set of formatting instructions on how to extract names and professions and then format them exactly the way we want, or we could just **provide Claude with some correctly-formatted examples and Claude can extrapolate from there**. Note the `<individuals>` in the `assistant` turn to start Claude off on the right foot.

## Exercises
- [Exercise 7.1 - Email Formatting via Examples](#exercise-71---email-formatting-via-examples)

### Exercise 7.1 - Email Formatting via Examples
We're going to redo Exercise 6.2, but this time, we're going to edit the `PROMPT` to use "few-shot" examples of emails + proper classification (and formatting) to get Claude to output the correct answer. We want the *last* letter of Claude's output to be the letter of the category.

Refer to the comments beside each email in the `EMAILS` list if you forget which letter category is correct for each email.

Remember that these are the categories for the emails:										
- (A) Pre-sale question
- (B) Broken or defective item
- (C) Billing question
- (D) Other (please explain)								

```python
# Prompt template with a placeholder for the variable content
PROMPT = """Please classify this email as either green or blue: {email}"""

# Prefill for Claude's response
PREFILL = ""

# Variable content stored as a list
EMAILS = [
    "Hi -- My Mixmaster4000 is producing a strange noise when I operate it. It also smells a bit smoky and plasticky, like burning electronics.  I need a replacement.", # (B) Broken or defective item
    "Can I use my Mixmaster 4000 to mix paint, or is it only meant for mixing food?", # (A) Pre-sale question OR (D) Other (please explain)
    "I HAVE BEEN WAITING 4 MONTHS FOR MY MONTHLY CHARGES TO END AFTER CANCELLING!!  WTF IS GOING ON???", # (C) Billing question
    "How did I get here I am not good with computer.  Halp." # (D) Other (please explain)
]

# Correct categorizations stored as a list of lists to accommodate the possibility of multiple correct categorizations per email
ANSWERS = [
    ["B"],
    ["A","D"],
    ["C"],
    ["D"]
]

# Iterate through list of emails
for i,email in enumerate(EMAILS):
    
    # Substitute the email text into the email placeholder variable
    formatted_prompt = PROMPT.format(email=email)
   
    # Get Claude's response
    response = get_completion(formatted_prompt, prefill=PREFILL)

    # Grade Claude's response
    grade = any([bool(re.search(ans, response[-1])) for ans in ANSWERS[i]])
    
    # Print Claude's response
    print("--------------------------- Full prompt with variable substutions ---------------------------")
    print("USER TURN")
    print(formatted_prompt)
    print("\nASSISTANT TURN")
    print(PREFILL)
    print("\n------------------------------------- Claude's response -------------------------------------")
    print(response)
    print("\n------------------------------------------ GRADING ------------------------------------------")
    print("This exercise has been correctly solved:", grade, "\n\n\n\n\n\n")
